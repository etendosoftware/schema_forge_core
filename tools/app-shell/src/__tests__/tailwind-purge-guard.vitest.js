/**
 * Tailwind purge regression guard (ETP-4083).
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * Tailwind's JIT engine only emits CSS for utility classes it actually finds
 * while scanning the files listed in the `content` globs of
 * `tools/app-shell/tailwind.config.js`. Any utility class that appears ONLY in
 * files outside those globs is silently PURGED from the final CSS — the build
 * does NOT fail, the rule just vanishes and the UI loses styling.
 *
 * This bit us in ETP-4083: the UI components were moved into the
 * `app-shell-core` workspace package source, but the `content` globs only
 * scanned the app's own source and the artifacts generated output. The semantic
 * popover-surface background utility (used by PopoverContent / DateField in the
 * core package, and by NOTHING in this app's own source) was purged, so the
 * date-picker calendar popover rendered with a TRANSPARENT background.
 *
 * The fix added the workspace-packages source glob to the `content` array so
 * every package source is scanned. This test reproduces the REAL build pipeline
 * (the actual tailwind.config.js resolved through postcss + the tailwindcss
 * plugin, with the same base/components/utilities layers the app ships via the
 * app-shell-core styles entry) and asserts that the critical semantic utilities
 * — used ONLY inside the app-shell-core package source — survive the purge.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — why the guarded class names are assembled from fragments and why
 * this comment never spells them out literally:
 * the production `content` globs include the app's own source tree, which means
 * THIS TEST FILE is itself scanned by Tailwind. If the literal guarded class
 * names appeared anywhere in this file (even in a comment), Tailwind would find
 * them here and keep the utilities alive even if the package glob were removed
 * — the guard would silently stop guarding. So the class tokens are assembled
 * at runtime from pieces that never form the literal class string in source.
 * DO NOT inline them, and do not mention them literally in comments.
 *
 * IF THIS TEST FAILS: a critical semantic utility was purged from the built
 * CSS. Almost certainly the `content` globs in
 * `tools/app-shell/tailwind.config.js` no longer cover the package source files
 * that use the class (most likely the workspace-packages source glob was
 * removed or narrowed). Restore that glob so Tailwind scans the package sources
 * again. The expected glob value is logged in each assertion's failure message.
 * See ETP-4083.
