# Product Category

## Intent

Product Category lets users maintain the category master record that classifies products and configure the accounting accounts associated with each category per accounting schema. The main form covers the category header fields; the Accounting tab exposes the GL accounts linked to each accounting schema for that category.

## What this window should allow

Users should be able to:

- browse product categories by Search Key and Name
- open a category and maintain its header fields: Search Key, Name, Description, Default, and Summary Level
- view and edit accounting accounts (Asset, Expense, Revenue, COGS) for the category directly from the Accounting grid, using inline editing with pencil and trash icons on hover

## Interaction model

- **Route:** `/product-category`, `/product-category/:recordId`
- **Visibility:** visible in the Inventory menu as **Product Category**
- **Implementation type:** generated window loaded from the app-shell registry
- **Window shape:** master + inline-editable detail; `productCategory` is the header entity and `accounting` is the detail entity rendered as an inline-editable grid
- **List behavior:** the category list shows Search Key and Name and supports filtering by those same fields
- **Record behavior:** opening a category record renders a detail view with the category header form plus the **Accounting** tab with `linesLayout="inlineEditable"`
- **Accounting tab behavior:** shows one row per accounting schema. Each row exposes four ValidCombination FK selectors (Product Asset, Product Expense, Product Revenue, Product COGS). Rows are edited inline — hovering a row reveals a pencil (edit) and a trash (delete) icon. All four selector columns share the available width equally via `grow: true`.
- An **Attachments** tab is available in the detail tab strip.

## Layout configuration

The window uses these layout overrides (all set in `decisions.json → window`):

| Key | Value | Effect |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `detailEntity` | `"accounting"` | Accounting tab as the primary child entity |
| `linesLayout` | `"inlineEditable"` | Inline pencil/trash editing on Accounting rows |
| `noHeaderBorder` | `true` | Removes the border under the header form |
| `toolbarBorderBottom` | `true` | Adds a border below the toolbar |
| `formCardPadding` | `"p-2"` | Tighter padding on the form card |
| `formScrollPaddingX` | `"px-2"` | Horizontal padding on the scroll column |
| `toolbarPaddingX` | `"px-2"` | Horizontal padding on the toolbar |
| `tabsBarPaddingX` | `"px-2"` | Horizontal padding on the tabs bar |

## Reactive behavior and dependencies

- The Accounting grid depends on the selected category record and loads rows filtered by `parentId`.
- The four accounting fields are ValidCombination FK selectors backed by the OBUISEL selector `A085BAFF89C74D7696A877C697DF350F`. The selector WHERE clause (`e.active = true and e.accountingSchema.id=@inpcAcctschemaId@`) drops the `@inpcAcctschemaId@` clause at runtime since that context param is not available in NEO's stateless selector requests, returning all active combinations.
- The selector display value uses the `combination` property of `C_ValidCombination` (e.g. `"35000 - Productos terminados A"`).
- No dependent selectors with query params are defined for this window.
- The category header exposes no status field, summary badges, or process actions.
- `assignedProducts` and `translation` entities are excluded from the window scope.

## Gap assessment

- Accounting rows are pre-created by Etendo (one per accounting schema). The window allows editing existing rows but adding/deleting accounting schema rows is not a typical use case and is not explicitly gated.
- No totals, financial reactions, or callout chains are visible in the accounting entity contract.

## Manual verification

1. Open `/product-category` and confirm the list filters Search Key and Name.
2. Open an existing category and confirm the header form shows Search Key, Name, Description, Default, and Summary Level.
3. Confirm the **Accounting** tab is the active detail tab and shows one row per accounting schema.
4. Hover over an accounting row and confirm the pencil and trash icons appear.
5. Click the pencil icon and confirm all four selector fields become editable inline within their column boundaries.
6. Open a selector and confirm it returns ValidCombination records showing combination strings (e.g. `"35000 - Productos terminados A"`), not UUIDs.
7. Confirm all four selector columns share the row width equally (no single column dominating the space).
8. Open the **Attachments** tab and confirm file upload, download, and delete work as expected.

## Automated evidence

- `tools/app-shell/src/menu.json` places **Product Category** under the Inventory menu.
- `tools/app-shell/src/windows/registry.js` registers the `product-category` slug.
- `artifacts/product-category/contract.json` defines the window with `productCategory` as primary entity, `accounting` as detail entity with `linesLayout: "inlineEditable"`, and four ValidCombination selector fields.
- `artifacts/product-category/generated/web/product-category/ProductCategoryPage.jsx` renders `ListView` for the list route and `DetailView` with `linesLayout="inlineEditable"` and `DetailTable={AccountingTable}` for record routes.
- `artifacts/product-category/generated/web/product-category/AccountingTable.jsx` renders `InlineLinesPanel` when `linesLayout === "inlineEditable"`, otherwise `DataTable`. The three non-first selector columns declare `grow: true` so all four share the row width equally.
- `artifacts/product-category/generated/web/product-category/AccountingForm.jsx` is generated but not used in the current layout (inline editing replaces the side-panel form).
- No dedicated Product Category browser test was found. Shared route/loading behavior is documented in `docs/generated-custom-windows/app-shell-functional-flows.md`.

## Pipeline regeneration — ETP-4192

Regenerated on 2026-06-09 as part of feature/ETP-4192.

**Changes in this cycle:**

- `detailEntity` changed from `assignedProducts` to `accounting`; `assignedProducts` and `translation` entities excluded.
- `linesLayout: "inlineEditable"` added — Accounting tab now uses `InlineLinesPanel` with pencil/trash row actions.
- Layout properties added: `noHeaderBorder`, `toolbarBorderBottom`, `formCardPadding`, `formScrollPaddingX`, `toolbarPaddingX`, `tabsBarPaddingX`.
- `description` field configured with `span: 2, rows: 1`; `image` field discarded.
- `grow: true` added to `productExpense`, `productRevenue`, and `productCOGS` so all four accounting selector columns share the row width equally.
- Pipeline additions used by this window: `span`, `rows`, `explicitType`, `formScrollPaddingX`, and `grow` support in `resolve-curated.js`, `generate-contract.js`, and `generate-frontend.js`.
- Backend fix (NEO Headless): `SelectorValidationResolver` now drops OBUISEL AND-clauses containing unresolvable `@param@` tokens instead of substituting `NULL`, which caused ValidCombination selectors to always return 0 results.
- Backend fix (NEO Headless): `SelectorDescriptorResolver.findIdentifierProperty` now returns `"combination"` for entities that have that property (e.g. `AccountingCombination`) before falling back to `"id"`.
- Frontend fix (`InlineSearchCombo`): root wrapper div now has `w-full` so selector inputs fill the full column width in inline edit mode.
- Frontend fix (`linesColumnWidth`): `columnFlex` for selector/search/foreignKey columns now honors `col.grow` to override the default `idx === 0` grow behavior.
