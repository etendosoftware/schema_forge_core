# Warehouse

## Intent

Use this window to maintain warehouse master records and understand what is physically stored in and moving through each warehouse. Beyond basic setup, the window surfaces operational stock data — total valuation, products with stock, per-product quantities — and provides a full transaction history tracing how stock arrived, moved, or left the warehouse.

## What this window should allow

- Create, review, and update a warehouse header with Search Key, Name, Location / Address, and Description.
- After creation, observe that a default storage bin is automatically created with the coordinate pattern `<searchKey>-0-0-0`.
- Open a saved warehouse and use the detail surface as an operational workspace: view stock data in the sidebar, inspect per-product stock in the Products tab, and trace movements in the Transactions tab.
- Follow navigable links from transaction rows directly to the source document (goods receipt, goods shipment, goods movement, or physical inventory) when a GO window exists for that document type.
- Attach files to a warehouse record via the Attachments tab.

## Interaction model

- Route: `/warehouse` for the list, `/warehouse/:recordId` for detail.
- Visibility: visible from the Inventory menu as **Warehouse**.
- Implementation type: custom window. `tools/app-shell/src/windows/registry.js` resolves `warehouse` through `customLoaders`. The custom wrapper (`tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/warehouse/index.jsx`) mounts the generated `WarehousePage` with overridden table, sidebar, secondary tabs, and layout props.
- Window shape: single-entity master with custom secondary tabs. `decisions.json` declares `detailEntity: null`; the detail page combines the warehouse header form with stock-derived surfaces (sidebar summary, Products tab, Transactions tab) and the standard Attachments tab.

## List view

The list uses `WarehouseCustomTable` in place of the default generated table. Columns:

| Column | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Name** | Bold, `font-semibold`, color `#121217` |
| **Identifier** (Search Key) | Pill badge: `bg-[#F5F7F9]`, rounded-lg, `text-xs`, color `#3F3F50` |
| **Location** | Resolved from `locationAddress$_identifier`, falls back to raw `locationAddress`. Not sortable. |
| **Products** | Dynamic count cell (`WarehouseProductCountCell`): fetches storageBins then binContents per warehouse row, aggregates via `aggregateProducts`, displays count of products with `qty > 0`. Shows `—` while loading or on error. Not sortable. |

Print and Link buttons are hidden (`hidePrint`, `hideLink`). Custom sort and refresh icons match the Products window style (`SortIcon`, `RefreshIcon` from `@/components/ui/custom-icons`). List toolbar and table use 8 px horizontal/vertical padding throughout (`listbarPaddingX="px-2"`, `tablePaddingX="px-2"`, etc.).

Search filters on `searchKey` and `name`.

## Detail view

### Layout

The detail page uses a split layout:

- **Left side**: header form + tabs below it.
- **Right sidebar** (30% width, `w-[30%]`): contains only `WarehouseSummary`. The sidebar is constrained to the area above the tabs (`sidebarAboveTabsOnly`), so tabs span the full width below the form.

Visual separators: `toolbarBorderBottom` draws a line between the toolbar and the form area; `tabsSeparator` draws a line between the form/sidebar and the tabs strip. The form area uses `p-2` (`formCardPadding`), scroll areas use `px-2` (`formScrollPaddingX`), and the tab content area uses `p-2 overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-380px)]`.

`noHeaderBorder` removes the default form card border.

### Form fields

4-column layout (`formCols: 4`). Visible fields in sequence order:

| Field | seq | span | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| Search Key | 1 | 1 | Searchable, shown in grid |
| Name | 2 | 1 | Searchable, shown in grid |
| Location / Address | 3 | 2 | Shown in grid |
| Description | 4 | 4 (full row) | `rows: 1` (single-line height) |

Discarded fields (not shown anywhere): `warehouseRule`, `storageBinSeparator`, `shipmentVehicle`, `shipperCode`, `fromDocumentNo`, `toDocumentNo`, `mReturnlocatorID`, `allocated`. The `discardPatterns: ["EM_*"]` rule additionally suppresses all Etendo module extension fields from the header form.

### After-create behavior

On successful warehouse creation, the wrapper calls `createDefaultStorageBin`, which POSTs to `/sws/neo/warehouse/storageBin` with:

```json
{
  "warehouse": "<warehouse.id>",
  "organization": "<warehouse.organization>",
  "searchKey": "<warehouse.searchKey>-0-0-0",
  "rowX": "0", "stackY": "0", "levelZ": "0",
  "relativePriority": 50,
  "default": true
}
```

If this POST fails, the warehouse remains saved and a `toast.warning` is shown — no rollback of the warehouse itself.

## Sidebar — Stock Data

`WarehouseSummary` renders above the tabs on the right side. It calls `useWarehouseStock` and displays two metrics:

| Metric | i18n key | Value |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Total Valuation | `warehouseTotalValuation` | Sum of `etgoValuation` across all aggregated products with `qty > 0`, formatted via `formatCurrency(currencyCode, totalValuation)`. Currency from `useCurrency()`, defaults to `USD`. |
| Products with Stock | `warehouseProductsWithStock` | Count of products with `qty > 0` (i.e., `aggregateProducts` output length). |

Each metric has a badge below the value:

- Valuation badge (`warehouseValuationBadge`): `bg-[#F5F7F9]`, text `#3F3F50` — label "Stock × current cost" / "Stock × coste actual".
- Products badge (`warehouseProductsWithStockBadge`): `bg-emerald-50`, text `emerald-700` — label "In stock > 0" / "Con existencia > 0".

While data is loading, the sidebar shows a loading message (`warehouseLoadingStock`). On error, it shows an error message (`warehouseStockError`).

## Data layer — `useWarehouseStock`

Both `WarehouseSummary` and `WarehouseProductsTab` share this hook. `WarehouseTransactionsTable` also uses it for the `transactions` slice.

Fetch sequence on warehouse selection:

1. In parallel: fetch all storage bins (`/storageBin?parentId=<warehouseId>&_startRow=0&_endRow=100`) and UOM translations (`/binContents/selectors/uOM?_startRow=0&_endRow=500`).
2. For each bin, in parallel: fetch `binContents` (up to 1 000 rows per bin) and `productTransactions` (up to 2 000 rows per bin).
3. Flatten all bin contents, call `aggregateProducts(allContents, uomMap)` to produce the `products` array.
4. Flatten all transaction rows, expose as `transactions`.

`aggregateProducts` (`warehouseUtils.js`): deduplicates `M_Storage_Detail` rows by `product` ID, summing `quantityOnHand` and `etgoValuation`. Only products with `qty > 0` after summing are retained. UOM is resolved from the `uomMap` selector cache first, then from `uOM$_identifier`, then from the raw UOM ID.

The `WarehouseCustomTable` product-count cell runs the same fetch sequence independently (no shared state with the detail hook).

## Tabs

### Products tab

Registered as secondary tab with key `products`, label `warehouseProductsTab`, panel `WarehouseProductsTab`.

Renders a plain `<table>` — no DataTable component, no sort arrows, no search. Columns:

| Column | Alignment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Product | left | `product$_identifier` |
| UOM | left | Resolved from `uomMap` or `uOM$_identifier` |
| Valuation | right, tabular-nums | `formatCurrency(currencyCode, p.valuation)`. Shows `—` when valuation is falsy. |
| Stock | right, tabular-nums | Quantity on hand, formatted to 2 decimal places (`fmtQty`). |

Data comes from the `products` slice of `useWarehouseStock` — aggregated from `M_Storage_Detail` (via `binContents` endpoint) across all of the warehouse's storage bins. No image column. Empty state shows `warehouseNoStock` centered message.

Calls `onCount(products.length)` after load so the tab strip can display a count badge.

### Transactions tab

Registered as secondary tab with key `productTransactions`, label `warehouseTransactionsTab`, panel `WarehouseTransactionsTable`. The `productTransactions` entity in `decisions.json` declares `javaQualifier: "productTransactionsHandler"`, which routes NEO Headless through the `ProductTransactionsHandler` NeoHandler bean. That handler joins `M_Transaction` to its source line and header, injecting three fields onto each transaction row:

- `etgoDocHeaderId` — ID of the source document header
- `etgoDocWindow` — slug of the GO window that handles that document type
- `etgoDocLabel` — human-readable document identifier (document number, or `name` for physical inventories)

The tab fetches transactions from the `transactions` slice of `useWarehouseStock` (collected from all bins via `productTransactions?parentId=<binId>`), then sorts client-side by `movementDate` descending. Sort is fixed — no sort arrows, no user-accessible sort controls. No search.

Columns:

| Column | Alignment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Date | left, `font-semibold`, tabular-nums | `DD/MM/YYYY` format |
| Type | left, `text-muted-foreground` | Resolved from `movementType$_identifier` or mapped via `TYPE_KEY_MAP` i18n key |
| Document | left | Navigable `DocumentLink` (underline + ↗ icon) when `etgoDocWindow` and `etgoDocHeaderId` are present; plain text otherwise |
| Product | left | `product$_identifier` |
| Qty | right, tabular-nums, `font-semibold` | Positive: `emerald-600` with leading `+`. Negative: `text-destructive`. |

Movement type to source document mapping (resolved server-side by `ProductTransactionsHandler`):

| MovementType | Source join | GO window |
|---|---|---|
| `V+` | `M_InOutLine → M_InOut` | `goods-receipt` |
| `C-` | `M_InOutLine → M_InOut` (issotrx = Y) | `goods-shipment` |
| `M+` / `M-` | `M_MovementLine → M_Movement` | `goods-movements` |
| `I+` / `I-` | `M_InventoryLine → M_Inventory` | `physical-inventory` (identifier = `name` column, not `documentno`) |
| `P+` / `P-` | `M_ProductionLine → M_Production` | No GO window yet — plain text |
| `D-` / `D+` | `M_Internal_ConsumptionLine → M_Internal_Consumption` | No GO window yet — plain text |

`documentLabel()` prefers `etgoDocLabel`, then falls back to `goodsShipmentLine$_identifier`, `movementLine$_identifier`, `physicalInventoryLine$_identifier`, or `productionLine$_identifier`.

Empty state shows `warehouseNoTransactions` centered message.

Calls `onCount(transactions.length)` after load.

## Valuation mechanism

`EM_ETGO_VALUATION` is a column on `M_Storage_Detail` that stores `qtyonhand × current cost`. It is maintained by two EventHandlers in `com.etendoerp.go`:

- **`StorageDetailValuationHandler`**: fires on stock change events, updates the valuation for affected `M_Storage_Detail` rows.
- **`CostingValuationHandler`**: fires when the costing engine runs, uses a native SQL `UPDATE` (not Hibernate) to avoid session corruption during the costing batch. This ensures valuations stay consistent after retroactive cost changes.

The `binContents` entity in `decisions.json` exposes `etgoValuation` as a read-only grid column (`grid: true, form: false, visibility: "readOnly"`). The `aggregateProducts` helper sums this column across all bin-content rows for each product to produce the per-product and warehouse-total valuations shown in the sidebar and Products tab.

## Known gaps

- **Production and internal consumption not navigable**: transactions with movement types `P+`, `P-`, `D-`, `D+` have no corresponding GO window. The Document column renders plain text instead of a navigable link. This will remain until GO windows for those document types are built.
- **Default-bin uniqueness**: the after-create hook always attempts to POST `<searchKey>-0-0-0`. If a bin with that search key already exists, the POST may fail silently (user sees a warning toast). No backend uniqueness enforcement is documented here.
- **Storage bin management not surfaced**: `storageBin` is declared in `decisions.json` and available via the NEO API, but the custom warehouse page does not expose a dedicated bins tab or inline bin editing. Bin maintenance must happen through other means.
- **No bin-contents tab**: `binContents` data is consumed by the hook and aggregated into the Products tab view. There is no raw bin-contents surface exposed in the custom page.
- **Product count in list is async**: `WarehouseCustomTable` fetches product counts independently per row on render. In large lists this generates multiple parallel requests. Counts show `—` until resolved; errors also show `—` silently.
- **Transaction fetch ceiling**: the hook fetches up to 2 000 transactions per storage bin. Warehouses with very high transaction volumes may not show the full history.

- `tools/app-shell/src/windows/__tests__/registry.test.js` — proves the `warehouse` slug is registered in the window map.

## Manual verification

1. Open `/warehouse` and confirm the list shows Name (bold), Identifier (pill badge), Location, and Products (async count) columns. Confirm Print and Link buttons are absent.
2. Create a warehouse with Search Key, Name, and Location / Address. Save and confirm the detail opens with the sidebar on the right (above tabs only), a 4-column form, and the tabs spanning the full width below.
3. Confirm a default storage bin is created automatically with the `<searchKey>-0-0-0` pattern. If it fails, confirm a warning toast appears and the warehouse record still exists.
4. In the sidebar, confirm Total Valuation and Products with Stock display (or zero/empty state if no stock).
5. Open the **Products** tab and confirm rows show Product, UOM, Valuation (currency-formatted), and Stock columns with no sort arrows. Confirm zero-quantity products are absent.
6. Open the **Transactions** tab and confirm rows are sorted by date descending with no user-accessible sort. Confirm the Date column renders as `DD/MM/YYYY`.
7. For a goods-receipt transaction, confirm the Document column shows a navigable link (underline + ↗) that navigates to `/goods-receipt/<id>`.
8. For a production or internal-consumption transaction, confirm the Document column shows plain text (no link).
9. Confirm positive quantities are green with a leading `+` and negative quantities are red.
10. Open a saved record and confirm the **Attachments** tab is visible in the tab strip. Upload a file, download it, and delete it. When multiple files exist, confirm **Download all (ZIP)** and **Delete all** (with confirmation dialog) appear.
