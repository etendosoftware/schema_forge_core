# Fiscal Config

## Intent

Use this window to configure the electronic invoicing system for an organization — selecting the correct regime (SII, TBAI, SII+TBAI, or Verifactu) based on the organization's fiscal territory, and then filling in the operational details required by the corresponding tax authority.

The window serves two distinct phases: onboarding (first-time setup via a guided wizard) and ongoing configuration maintenance (editing the records created during onboarding).

## What this window should allow

- Guide new organizations through fiscal territory selection and system assignment via a 6-screen onboarding wizard.
- Detect which fiscal records already exist and render only the applicable section(s): SII, TBAI, SII+TBAI (combined), or Verifactu.
- Allow editing of operational fields for each system: fiscal year dates, SII submission cadences, TBAI certificate upload, and Verifactu editable fields only.
- Prompt certificate upload (`.p12`/`.pfx`) for systems that require it (TBAI, SII+TBAI, Verifactu) at the end of onboarding.
- Show a conflict warning when incompatible records coexist (e.g. Verifactu + SII).
- Persist Verifactu tax type using the AD enum codes (`01` IVA, `03` IGIC, `02` IPSI), while showing the human-readable labels in the custom UI.
- Normalize fiscal boolean fields from NEO (`true`/`false` or `Y`/`N`) so switches render correctly and writes persist the intended boolean state.

## Wizard screens

The onboarding wizard activates when the organization has no fiscal configuration records (`profile = unconfigured`). It walks through 6 logical screens:

| Screen | Key | When shown |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Territory selection | `territory` | Always first |
| Sub-question | `subquestion` | When territory has `askNational` or `askVolume` |
| Manual system selection | `manual` | When the user taps "Select manually"; if a territory was already chosen it stays preselected |
| Confirmation | `confirm` | After territory + sub-question resolved |
| Detail (operational fields) | `detail` | After confirmation creates DB records |
| Applied / success | `applied` | After a successful detail save |
| Skipped | `skipped` | When user explicitly skips |

Territory groups and their regimes:

| Regime | Territories | Sub-question asked |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| `sii_foral` | Navarra | None (always SII) |
| `tbai` | Álava, Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa | `askNational`: also SII national? |
| `siiver` | España/Baleares, Canarias, Ceuta/Melilla | `askVolume`: billing > or ≤ 6.010.121 € |

`resolveSystem({ regime, alsoNational, volume, lowChoice })` in `fiscalConfig.utils.js` is the pure function that maps those answers to a final system (`SII`, `TBAI`, `SII+TBAI`, or `VERIFACTU`).

The manual screen still enforces territory-driven compatibility, but it no longer requires a prior selection on the first screen. Users can open manual mode directly, pick a territory there, and then choose one of the compatible systems. If they had already chosen a territory on the first screen, that territory appears preselected in the manual screen.

Changing the territory in either the main wizard screen or the manual screen resets the auto-flow answers (`alsoNational`, billing volume, and low-volume choice) so stale answers from a previous territory cannot leak into the confirmation summary. When the user reaches confirmation from manual mode, the back button returns to the manual screen rather than to the automatic sub-question flow.

## Profile detection

`detectProfile(sii, tbai, verifactu)` in `fiscalConfig.utils.js` derives the active profile from the presence and flags of the 3 config records:

| Profile | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| `unconfigured` | All 3 records null |
| `sii` | SII record present, no special flags |
| `sii-navarra` | SII record with `navarra=Y` |
| `sii+tbai` | Both SII and TBAI records exist; OR SII record with `guipuzcoa=Y` (legacy fallback for Gipuzkoa) |
| `tbai` | Only TBAI record present |
| `verifactu` | Only Verifactu record present |
| `conflict` | Verifactu + SII or Verifactu + TBAI both exist |

## Interaction model

- Route: `/fiscal-config` (custom window, not generated).
- Visibility: visible in the Settings menu.
- Implementation type: `layoutType: "custom"` — loaded from `customLoaders` in `tools/app-shell/src/windows/registry.js`.
- Entry point: `FiscalConfigPage.jsx` — determines profile and delegates to wizard or section components.

## Data model

Three independent NEO Headless entities (one per system):

| System | Entity spec | Entity name |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| SII | `sii-config` | `siiConfiguration` |
| TBAI | `tbai-config` | `header` |
| Verifactu | `verifactu-config` | `cabeceraDeConfiguraciónVerifactu` |

Records are POST-created during wizard confirmation step and then edited in the detail step. `useFiscalConfig.js` parallelizes the 3 GET fetches and derives the profile client-side.

## Certificate upload (CertModal + CertSection)

`CertSection.jsx` renders the certificate status widget inside SII, TBAI, and Verifactu section forms. On mount it calls `GET /sws/neo/certificate?orgId=` to restore the cert status from `etsg_certificate`, so the "loaded" state persists across window refreshes. `CertModal.jsx` is the 3-step upload modal (pick → verify spinner → done/confirmNif).

### Backend endpoints (`NeoCertificateHelper`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/sws/neo/certificate` | Upload a PKCS#12 cert via `multipart/form-data` (fields: `certificate`, `orgId`, `password`, optional `setOrgNif`) |
| `GET`  | `/sws/neo/certificate?orgId=` | Return `{exists, validTo}` for the active cert of that org |

The upload delegates to `AddCertificateToOrg` (existing SIF process) via reflection.

### NIF/CIF validation

Before storing the cert the backend parses the X.509 subject DN to extract the org NIF, using this priority order:

1. `organizationIdentifier` (OID 2.5.4.97) — FNMT RPJ certs; holds the company CIF.
2. `SERIALNUMBER` (OID 2.5.4.5) — personal/autónomo certs; holds the person's NIF.
3. `CN=… (R: NIF)` — fallback for older FNMT formats.

The extracted NIF is then compared (case-insensitive, hyphen-stripped) against `ad_orginfo.taxid`. Values `null`, empty, or `'?'` are treated as "org has no NIF configured". Three outcomes:

- **Match** — proceed to store.
- **No org NIF** — return `{pendingNifConfirmation: true, certNif}`. Frontend shows a confirmation step; if the user confirms, client re-posts with `setOrgNif=true` and the backend writes the NIF to `ad_orginfo.taxid`.
- **Mismatch** — return HTTP 422 with an explanatory error message.

`NeoCertificateHelperTest.java` (17 unit tests) covers `parseNifFromDn` and `normalizeNif` for all supported certificate formats.

## Certificate expiry banner (`CertExpiryBanner`)

`CertExpiryBanner.jsx` renders a warning notice when the organization's digital certificate is approaching expiry. It is shown in `FiscalConfigPage.jsx` with `variant="prominent"` (card style, after the page header). `useCertExpiry.js` fetches `GET /certificate?orgId=` on mount and computes the remaining days via the exported `daysUntil(dateStr)` pure helper.

| Days remaining | State | Appearance | Dismissible |
|----------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| > 60 | Hidden | — | — |
| 31 – 60 | Warning | Amber card with ⚠️ icon | Yes |
| 0 – 30 | Critical | Red card with 🔴 icon | No |

- `daysUntil(dateStr)` lives in `certExpiryUtils.js` (pure, no React deps). Both `todayUtc` and `expiryUtc` are built with `Date.UTC` from UTC date parts (`getUTCFullYear/Month/Date`), so the 60/30-day thresholds fire at UTC midnight regardless of the user's local timezone. Impossible dates (e.g. Feb 31) are rejected via a round-trip check before the diff is computed.
- When `isCritical` the dismiss button is not rendered; re-opening the page always shows the banner until the cert is renewed.
- The `dismissed` flag is local to the component instance (resets on page reload) — intentionally, to keep the warning visible to all users who open the page.

i18n keys used:
- `fiscal.cert.expiry.warn.title` — "Certificate expiring in {days} days"
- `fiscal.cert.expiry.critical.title` — "Certificate expires in {days} days"
- `fiscal.cert.expiry.body` — renewal call-to-action sentence
- `fiscal.cert.expiry.dismiss` — aria-label for the × button

Debug: the debug panel exposes a "Cert expiry" section with three toggle buttons (None / 45d warn / 20d crit) that inject a mock `daysLeft` value into the hook, bypassing the API entirely.

## `onGoHome` prop

`OnboardingWizard` accepts an optional `onGoHome` prop. If provided, "Ir al inicio" (applied screen) and "Ir al inicio" (skipped screen) will call it instead of `onComplete`. This allows the host application to navigate to a dashboard or first-steps screen rather than staying in the fiscal-config window. When omitted, both buttons fall back to `onComplete`.

## Wizard applied step — cert auto-check

When the wizard reaches the `applied` step, a `useEffect` fires to fetch the current cert status from `GET /certificate?orgId=`. If the cert already exists (i.e. the user uploaded it during the `detail` step via `CertSection`), `setCert()` is called immediately — this prevents the "Upload digital certificate [PENDING]" next-step item from remaining shown after a successful upload.

Without this fetch the wizard's top-level `cert` state would only update when the cert is uploaded through `CertModal` on the applied step itself, not through `CertSection` inside the detail step. The two components have independent state; the API call bridges them.

## Manual verification

1. Delete any existing SII/TBAI/Verifactu records for the test org, open `/fiscal-config`, and confirm the wizard territory screen appears.
2. Select "España/Baleares", confirm the volume sub-question appears, choose "≤ 6M€", choose "Verifactu", advance to confirm, and verify the summary shows Verifactu before pressing "Confirmar".
3. After confirmation, verify the detail screen shows the Verifactu form. Press "Guardar y aplicar" and confirm the applied screen appears with the success card.
4. Select "Álava" and choose "SII + TicketBAI", advance to confirm. After confirmation, verify both SiiSection and TbaiSection appear in the detail screen.
5. Upload a `.p12` certificate in the CertModal; confirm the stepper advances through pick → verify → done (or through the confirmNif step if the org has no taxid). Close and reopen the window — the "Certificado cargado" state should still show (persisted via GET endpoint).
5a. In the wizard, upload the certificate during the `detail` step (via `CertSection`), then advance to the `applied` step — confirm the "Upload digital certificate" item shows as completed (not PENDING).
5b. In the debug panel, enable "45d warn" — confirm the amber expiry banner appears in the page header. Enable "20d crit" — confirm it turns red and the dismiss button disappears.
6. Open `/fiscal-config` with an org that already has an SII record and confirm the wizard is NOT shown — only SiiSection renders.
7. Open `/fiscal-config` with an org that has both SII and Verifactu records and confirm the conflict warning renders.
8. Press "Omitir por ahora" on the territory screen and confirm the skipped screen shows with a "← Volver al asistente" button that returns to territory selection.
