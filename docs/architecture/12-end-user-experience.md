### Typical User Session

1. **Login:** User enters credentials. Etendo validates against `AD_User`, creates `AD_Session` record, returns session token
2. **Dashboard:** Landing page shows KPIs, recent records, pending alerts
3. **Navigate:** User clicks a window in the sidebar or uses the command palette
4. **List view:** DataTable loads with default filters. User can search, sort, filter, paginate
5. **Detail view:** User clicks a record. EntityForm shows editable and read-only fields. System fields are hidden
6. **Edit and save:** User modifies fields. On save, EventHandlers execute derivations (document number, computed totals), then the record is persisted
7. **Execute process:** User clicks a process button (e.g., "Complete Order"). Precondition validators check eligibility. Process executes. User sees success/failure feedback
8. **Notifications:** Toasts for success, field-level errors for validation failures, modal dialogs for critical confirmations

## 2. Performance Targets

From the user's perspective, responsiveness determines whether the system feels fast or sluggish.

| Action | Target | Perceived as | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Login to dashboard | < 2s | Instant | Includes auth + SPA load + dashboard data |
| Navigate to window | < 1s | Instant | Dynamic import + API call for initial data |
| Load list (50 records) | < 1s | Instant | Paginated, default sort |
| Load list (200 records) | < 2s | Fast | Maximum page size |
| Save record | < 500ms | Instant | Includes EventHandler derivations |
| Execute process | < 3s | Acceptable | Complex processes may take longer; show progress indicator |
| Search autocomplete | < 300ms | Real-time | FK selector dropdown population |
| Filter/sort list | < 500ms | Instant | Client-side if data is loaded; server-side for new query |

**Current state:** Most targets are unverified. Mock data in development shows ~500ms window navigation, but real API calls with production data volumes have not been measured.

**Measurement approach:** Use the observability metrics from [10-observability.md](10-observability.md) (specifically `sf_api_request_duration_seconds`) to track actual performance against these targets.

## 3. Error Experience

### 3.1 Error Types and User-Facing Behavior

| Error Type | What the User Sees | Current Behavior | Recommended Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Validation error** | Field-level error messages (red text below the field) | Handled by EntityForm validation | Working as designed. Ensure messages are localized via i18n |
| **API error (4xx)** | Toast notification with error message | Partial: some errors show toast, others are silent | Consistent toast with user-friendly message. Record stays dirty (unsaved changes preserved) |
| **API error (5xx)** | Toast notification with generic error | Partial: raw Java exception may leak to user | Never show stack traces. Show "Something went wrong. Please try again." with a detail-expand option for support reference |
| **Process precondition failure** | Modal or toast explaining why the process cannot run | Handled by precondition validators | Working as designed. Ensure messages explain what the user should do to fix the condition |
| **Process execution failure** | Error message after process runs | Depends on process implementation | Show clear failure message. If transaction rolled back, indicate that no data was changed |
| **Network error** | No response from server | No handling (loading spinner forever) | Show "Connection lost" banner. Offer retry button. Preserve form state |
| **Session expired (401)** | Silent failures or confusing behavior | No centralized handling | Redirect to login page. Preserve the current URL as a return path. Show "Your session has expired" |
| **Window load failure** | White screen | No ErrorBoundary | Show error boundary with "This window could not be loaded. Try again." button |
| **Unhandled JS exception** | White screen (entire SPA crashes) | No top-level ErrorBoundary | Show app-level error boundary with "Something went wrong" and option to return to dashboard |

### 3.2 Error Message Guidelines

- Use plain language, not technical jargon
- Tell the user what happened and what they can do about it
- Include a reference ID (requestId) for support escalation
- Never expose Java stack traces, SQL errors, or internal class names
- Localize all error messages via the i18n system

**Example:**

| Instead of | Show |
|-----------|------|
| `OBException: com.etendoerp.go.salesorder.event.SalesOrderEventHandler: NullPointerException` | "The order could not be saved. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact support. (Ref: req-a1b2c3d4)" |
| `PSQLException: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint` | "A record with this identifier already exists. Please use a different value." |
| `StaleObjectStateException` | "This record was modified by another user. Please refresh and try again." |

---

## 4. Offline Capability

### 4.1 Current State

| Capability | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **App shell caching** | Yes (PWA service worker caches HTML, JS, CSS) |
| **Window component caching** | Yes (dynamic imports cached by service worker) |
| **API data caching** | No (all data requires network) |
| **Offline form submission** | No |
| **Offline indicator** | No |

The SPA can load from cache when offline, but all meaningful operations (list, save, process) require a network connection to the Etendo backend.

### 4.2 Offline User Experience (Current)

1. User opens the app while offline
2. App shell loads from service worker cache
3. User navigates to a window
4. Window component loads from cache
5. API call for data fails silently
6. User sees loading spinner indefinitely (no timeout, no error)

### 4.3 Recommended Offline Improvements

**Short-term (no backend changes):**

| Improvement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Offline indicator** | Show a persistent banner: "You are offline. Some features are unavailable." |
| **API timeout + error** | After 10 seconds, show "Cannot reach server" instead of infinite spinner |
| **Last-viewed data** | Cache the last API response per window in IndexedDB. Show stale data with a "data may be outdated" warning |
| **Form state preservation** | Store unsaved form data in localStorage. Restore when user returns to the window |

**Long-term (requires backend support):**

| Improvement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Offline queue** | Queue save operations in IndexedDB while offline. Sync when connectivity returns |
| **Conflict resolution** | When syncing queued saves, detect if the record was modified by another user. Show conflict resolution UI |
| **Selective sync** | Allow users to mark records for offline access. Sync those records proactively |

> **Pragmatic note:** Full offline ERP capability is complex and may not be worth the investment for a typical deployment where users are on a reliable corporate network. The short-term improvements (offline indicator, timeout handling, form state preservation) provide the most value for the least effort.

## 5. Accessibility

### 5.1 Current State

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Semantic HTML** | Partial | shadcn/ui components use proper ARIA attributes |
| **Keyboard navigation** | Partial | Tab order in forms works, but DataTable lacks keyboard navigation |
| **Screen reader support** | Partial | Field labels come from i18n files, but dynamic content (toasts, loading states) may not announce |
| **Color contrast** | Good (default) | Tailwind CSS defaults meet WCAG AA contrast ratios |
| **Focus management** | Partial | Focus is not always managed correctly after navigation or dialog open/close |
| **Skip navigation** | Missing | No "skip to content" link for keyboard users |
| **Dark mode** | Unknown | Tailwind supports it, but not confirmed as implemented |
| **Responsive layout** | Partial | Sidebar collapses, but forms may not reflow properly on small screens |
| **Touch targets** | Unknown | Buttons may be too small for mobile touch |

### 5.2 WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Fix |
|-----|--------|-----|
| No skip-to-content link | Keyboard users must tab through entire sidebar to reach content | Add `<a href="#main-content" class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to content</a>` |
| DataTable not keyboard-navigable | Users cannot browse table rows with arrow keys | Implement `role="grid"` with arrow key navigation |
| Toast notifications not announced | Screen readers miss success/error feedback | Add `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` to toast container |
| Focus not trapped in modals | Tab key moves focus behind the modal | Use `<dialog>` element or implement focus trap |
| Loading states not announced | Screen readers do not know the page is loading | Add `aria-busy="true"` and `aria-live` region for loading status |
| Form errors not associated | Error messages not linked to their input field | Use `aria-describedby` pointing to the error message element |

### 5.3 Recommended Actions

1. Run an automated accessibility audit (axe-core or Lighthouse Accessibility)
2. Fix all automatically detectable issues (typically 40-60% of problems)
3. Manual keyboard-only testing: navigate the full user journey without a mouse
4. Screen reader testing (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows) on key flows
5. Add accessibility checks to the build pipeline (axe-core in CI)

---

## 6. Localization

### 6.1 Current State

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Supported locales** | en_US (English), es_ES (Spanish) |
| **Field labels** | 2884 labels populated from Etendo DB |
| **Locale switching** | In-app locale switcher component |
| **Label resolution** | Key-based lookup from `{locale}.json` files via `LocaleProvider` |
| **RTL support** | Not implemented |
| **Number formatting** | Unknown (may not be locale-aware) |
| **Date formatting** | Unknown (may not be locale-aware) |
| **Currency formatting** | Unknown (Etendo is multi-currency, this needs special handling) |

### 6.2 Adding a New Locale

1. Create `public/locales/{locale_code}.json` (e.g., `fr_FR.json`)
2. Populate with translated labels (same keys as `en_US.json`)
3. Register the locale in `LocaleProvider` configuration
4. Add the locale to the locale switcher dropdown
5. Test: verify all 2884+ labels render correctly, no missing keys

### 6.3 Localization Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Missing number formatting** | Users see numbers in US format regardless of locale (1,000.00 vs 1.000,00) | CRITICAL for non-US deployments |
| **Missing date formatting** | Dates show as MM/DD/YYYY instead of locale-appropriate format | CRITICAL for non-US deployments |
| **Missing currency formatting** | Currency symbols and positions not locale-aware | CRITICAL for multi-currency ERP |
| **No RTL support** | Arabic, Hebrew users cannot use the application | WARNING (only if RTL locales are needed) |
| **Error messages not localized** | Backend error messages arrive in English regardless of user locale | WARNING |
| **Hardcoded strings in components** | Any string not going through i18n system won't translate | WARNING |

### 6.4 Recommended Approach for Formatting

Use the `Intl` API (built into all modern browsers):

```javascript
// Number formatting
new Intl.NumberFormat('es-ES', { style: 'decimal' }).format(1234.56)
// → "1.234,56"

// Date formatting
new Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-ES', { dateStyle: 'medium' }).format(new Date())
// → "11 mar 2026"

// Currency formatting
new Intl.NumberFormat('es-ES', { style: 'currency', currency: 'EUR' }).format(1234.56)
// → "1.234,56 €"
```

Integrate this into shared formatting utilities used by all generated windows.

## 7. Feedback Loops

### 7.1 Current State

| Channel | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Error reporting** | None. User calls support, describes the problem verbally |
| **Usage analytics** | None. No visibility into which features are used |
| **Feature requests** | Manual (email, meetings) |
| **Performance monitoring** | None (see [10-observability.md](10-observability.md)) |

### 7.2 Recommended Improvements

| Improvement | Description | Effort |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **In-app feedback button** | Floating button that captures screenshot + browser info + current URL and sends to support queue | Medium |
| **Error auto-reporting** | When ErrorBoundary catches an exception, automatically send error details (stack trace, component tree, requestId) to a logging endpoint | Medium |
| **Usage analytics** | Track page views, button clicks, and process executions. Use to identify most/least used features and optimize accordingly | Medium |
| **Session recording (opt-in)** | Record user sessions for UX research (tools: FullStory, Hotjar). Only with explicit user consent | High |

---

## 8. Critical UX Failure Points

Ranked by severity and user impact.

### 8.1 CRITICAL (System-breaking for the user)

| Issue | Description | Impact | Fix |
|-------|------------|--------|-----|
| **White screen on unhandled error** | No React ErrorBoundary in generated window code. Any unhandled JS exception crashes the entire SPA | User loses all context, must refresh, may lose unsaved data | Add ErrorBoundary per window and at the app root level |
| **Lost form data on session timeout** | When AD_Session expires, the next API call silently fails. No state preservation | User loses potentially minutes of data entry | Intercept 401, save form state to localStorage, redirect to login, restore state after re-login |
| **Process succeeds but user sees error** | Transaction commits successfully, but error occurs during response serialization. User thinks it failed, may re-execute | Data duplication (duplicate orders, double payments) | Ensure response serialization is within the try/catch. Add idempotency keys for critical processes |

### 8.2 WARNING (Degraded experience)

| Issue | Description | Impact | Fix |
|-------|------------|--------|-----|
| **Slow DataTable on large datasets** | No virtual scrolling. Rendering 500+ rows causes browser jank | Sluggish scrolling, high memory, poor perceived performance | Implement virtual scrolling (render visible rows only) |
| **Confusing error messages** | Raw Java exceptions shown to user | User cannot understand or act on the error | Implement error mapping layer: Java exception class to user-friendly message |
| **No undo for accidental saves** | Etendo has no soft-delete by default. Once saved, the previous state is gone | User cannot recover from accidental changes | Implement audit trail (Etendo's `AD_Changelog`) and a "revert to previous version" feature |
| **PWA update confusion** | New version available but not applied. User on old version may see bugs that were already fixed | User reports "fixed" bugs, confusion about current version | Implement update prompt: "A new version is available. Click to update." Force refresh on critical updates |
| **Infinite loading spinner** | No API timeout. If the server is slow or unreachable, the spinner shows forever | User waits indefinitely, eventually force-refreshes | Add 30-second timeout on all API calls. Show "Taking longer than expected. Retry?" |

### 8.3 Improvement Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** Fix CRITICAL items
- Add React ErrorBoundary (app-level + per-window)
- Add global 401 handler with login redirect and form state preservation
- Add API request timeouts (30 seconds)

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Fix WARNING items
- Implement error message mapping (Java exception to user-friendly text)
- Add PWA update notification prompt
- Add virtual scrolling to DataTable

**Phase 3 (Month 2+):** Improve experience
- In-app feedback mechanism
- Locale-aware number/date/currency formatting
- Accessibility audit and fixes
- Process idempotency keys
