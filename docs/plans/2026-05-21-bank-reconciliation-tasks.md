# Bank Reconciliation — Jira Tasks (Stories under ETP-3504)

**Parent epic:** [ETP-3504](https://etendo.atlassian.net/browse/ETP-3504) (Etendo Go)
**Parent plan:** [`2026-05-21-bank-reconciliation-module.md`](./2026-05-21-bank-reconciliation-module.md)
**Source spec:** `~/Downloads/Definicion_Funcional_Conciliacion_Bancaria.docx.pdf` (v1.0 Borrador, May 2026)
**Total tasks:** 8
**Conventions:** Etendo Git Police — `feature/ETP-XXXX` branches, `Feature ETP-XXXX: …` commits (≤80 chars first line), no `Co-Authored-By`.

> 🇪🇸 Cuando se creen las stories en Jira, cada una recibe su `ETP-XXXX` real bajo el epic **ETP-3504**. Los IDs `T1…T8` debajo son placeholders. PSD2 / Salt Edge ya está implementado en su propio módulo — la integración (T3) es solo cableado de UI. **T2 entrega el flujo sin conexión primero; T3 añade PSD2 después** para que el equipo de PSD2 pueda avanzar en paralelo.

## Architectural framing (mirrors Etendo Classic)

Etendo Classic has **no standalone Bank Reconciliation window** — reconciliation lives as an inner tab + a "Match Statement" process popup launched from the **Financial Account** window. The existing `bank-reconciliation` entry in Etendo Go is a synthetic placeholder (no `schema-raw.json`, invented fields) that does not correspond to any real Classic window.

These 8 tasks **retire that placeholder** and add a new menu entry **"Cuentas"** in Finance, backed by `FIN_Financial_Account` (same entity as Classic's "Financial Account") with reconciliation / matching / imported statements as internal tabs and popups. The result is structurally identical to Classic, with the redesigned UX defined by the Figma mockups in the **"PASANDO EN LIMPIO"** section of the functional document. See §2.5 of the parent plan for the full mapping.

## Task 1 — Build Accounts list page reading existing financial accounts

**Title (Jira):** Build Accounts list page reading existing financial accounts
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Build a new standalone Accounts landing page at `/finance/accounts` that replaces the current Bank Reconciliation entry point, matching the Figma mockups in the "PASANDO EN LIMPIO" section of the functional document.
* The page lists every active `FIN_Financial_Account` for the logged-in client / organization, including bank accounts, cash accounts, cards and payment-gateway accounts.
* A left sidebar shows: total balance, balance breakdown per currency, and a "Pending to reconcile" widget with three counters — accounts with pending lines, suggestions ready, and rule-based matches.
* The central table shows one row per account with: account logo + name, type, masked IBAN, current balance, and a "To reconcile" pill — either `Reconcile (N)`, `Connect PSD2`, or `—`.
* Each row exposes a kebab menu with the seven actions documented in section 5.1 (Open account, Edit account, Edit PSD2 connection, Sync now, Manual statement import, Disconnect PSD2, Archive account). In this ticket, only Open account is wired; the rest stay visible but disabled — they get activated in T2 / T5.
* A header bar exposes: a type filter dropdown (`All accounts / Bank / Cash / Card`) plus the `+ New account` and `Matching rules` buttons, both visible but disabled until T2 and T5 respectively.
* Clicking a row navigates to `/financial-account/{id}` (placeholder route is acceptable in this ticket — T4 materializes the detail view).

### Solution Design

**Frontend (Schema Forge):**

* New standalone page `tools/app-shell/src/pages/FinancialAccountsPage.jsx` (not under `artifacts/` since it is not an AD window — it is an aggregator view).
* Register the route in the app-shell router and add an entry to `tools/app-shell/src/menu.json` under the Finance group. The new entry coexists with the legacy `bank-reconciliation` entry until cutover.
* Sidebar component reads aggregates from a new endpoint `GET /financial-account/summary` returning `{ totalBalance, byCurrency: [{ currency, total }], pending: { accountsWithPending, suggestionsReady, byRule } }`.
* Central table reads from the NEO Headless `financial-account` spec. Configure the spec via Schema Forge artifact `artifacts/financial-account/` with `decisions.json` v2 and run `push-to-neo`. Columns mapped from `FIN_Financial_Account`: `Name`, `Type`, `IBAN`, `CurrentBalance`, `C_Currency_ID`, `IsActive`.
* Type filter applies a client-side filter on the cached dataset (server-side filter optional for large datasets).
* Row kebab is rendered via a `<DropdownMenu>` from `components/contract-ui/` — actions are declared in a static array with a `disabled` flag for non-Open entries.
* New i18n keys under `finance.accounts.*` added to both `en_US.json` and `es_ES.json`.

**Backend (com.etendoerp.go):**

* Extend `FinancialAccountHandler` (`@Named("financialAccount")` NeoHandler) with the new action endpoint:
  * `GET /financial-account/summary` → aggregates over the user's accessible orgs. SQL groups balances by `C_Currency_ID`. Pending counters call existing `FIN_Reconciliation` data.
* No new tables in this ticket.

**Out of scope:** functional kebab actions (T2), account creation/edit (T2), Matching rules navigation (T5), account detail view (T4), PSD2 wiring (T2).

### Test Cases

**Given** I am logged in as a user with multiple active financial accounts in different currencies
**When** I open `/finance/accounts`
**Then** the page lists every active account of my client / organizations with the correct name, type, masked IBAN and current balance.

**Given** my client has three EUR accounts and one USD account
**When** I open the Accounts page
**Then** the sidebar shows a total balance in EUR (sum of the EUR accounts) and a separate row for USD with its own total.

**Given** the type filter shows the dropdown options
**When** I select "Bank"
**Then** only accounts whose `Type` is Bank are rendered and the sidebar totals are recomputed for that subset.

**Given** an account row is visible in the list
**When** I click on the row (outside the kebab area)
**Then** the application navigates to `/financial-account/{id}`.

**Given** an account has 12 unreconciled bank statement lines
**When** the row is rendered
**Then** the "To reconcile" cell shows `Reconcile (12)` as a pill (button stays inert until T7 wires its action).

**Given** the header shows `+ New account` and `Matching rules` buttons
**When** I hover them
**Then** both remain disabled with a tooltip indicating they are part of a follow-up ticket.

## Task 2 — Implement offline account creation, edit and archive

**Title (Jira):** Implement offline account creation, edit and archive
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T1
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Deliver the **offline** account management flows accessible from the Accounts page: create accounts manually (no PSD2 connection), edit their general data, and archive them. The PSD2 wiring is deferred to T3 so this story stays small and PSD2 can be developed in parallel by the PSD2 module team.
* Enable the `+ New account` button on the Accounts page. Clicking it opens the New Account modal with a type picker limited to **Bank / Cash / Card**.
* Only the **"Sin conexión" (Without connection) tab is active** in this ticket; the "Con conexión" tab is visible but disabled, with a small badge that reads "Available in next iteration".
* Bank / Cash "Without connection" form: creates a `FIN_Financial_Account` manually (Name, IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, Currency, Accounting account). IBAN is validated client-side with the standard mod-97 algorithm.
* Enable the Edit account action in the row kebab: opens a modal with **general data only** (Internal name, Type, IBAN, Currency, Accounting account, Organization). A "Bank connection" section is rendered inside the modal but the entire section is disabled and shows a small "Available in next iteration" notice. The "Save changes" button submits only the general-data fields.
* Enable the Archive account action: soft-deletes the account (`IsActive='N'`) after confirmation. Archived accounts are hidden from the default Accounts list.
* Activate kebab actions: **Open account**, **Edit account**, **Archive account**. The PSD2-related entries (Edit PSD2 connection, Sync now, Manual statement import, Disconnect PSD2) stay disabled with tooltips pointing to T3.

### Solution Design

**Frontend (Schema Forge):**

* New `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/financial-account/NewAccountWizard.jsx` — modal with two steps: type picker (Bank / Cash / Card only) → form. For Bank, the form has two tabs: "Sin conexión" (active) and "Con conexión" (disabled placeholder with "Available in next iteration"). The Card type renders a minimal placeholder pointing to T3.
* New `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/financial-account/EditAccountModal.jsx` — modal with two sections: "Datos de la cuenta" (active) and "Conexión bancaria" (disabled placeholder). The header layout already matches the final Figma mockup so T3 can drop the live PSD2 panel in without re-layout.
* IBAN client-side validation via mod-97 checksum. Currency defaults to the user session currency. Accounting account uses the existing `C_ValidCombination` selector.
* Kebab actions wired through a shared hook `useAccountActions(account)` returning the bound handlers. Only `open`, `edit`, `archive` are exported in this ticket; `syncNow`, `manualImport`, `disconnect`, `editPsd2` are declared as stubs that throw a "Not implemented (T3)" error if called — they are not wired to any UI element here.
* Archive action shows a confirmation dialog before the POST.
* Vitest covers: form validation, happy submit, backend error surfacing, type picker behavior, archive confirmation dialog. "Con conexión" tab and PSD2 section are verified as disabled.

**Backend (com.etendoerp.go):**

* Extend `FinancialAccountHandler` (NeoHandler) with two action endpoints if not already present:
  * `POST /financial-account/{id}/action/archive` → set `IsActive='N'`. Reject with HTTP 409 if there are any open `FIN_Reconciliation` records for that account.
  * `GET /financial-account/{id}/defaults` → returns sensible defaults for the New Account form (`C_Currency_ID = @#C_Currency_ID@`, organization from session).
* Validation rule: account name unique per organization (returns HTTP 409 with the duplicate field surfaced inline).
* JUnit covers: archive rejection when reconciliations are open, duplicate-name validation, defaults endpoint.

**i18n:** new keys `finance.accounts.action.{open,edit,archive}`, `finance.accounts.new.*`, `finance.accounts.edit.*`. PSD2-specific labels are drafted but only activated in T3.

**Out of scope:** PSD2 / Salt Edge wiring (T3), credit-card PSD2 association (Jorge's separate work in the PSD2 module), detail view (T4).

### Test Cases

**Given** I am on the Accounts page and click `+ New account`
**When** I pick Bank and stay on the "Sin conexión" tab
**Then** the form shows fields Name, IBAN, BIC/SWIFT, Currency, Accounting account; submitting valid data creates the account and refreshes the list to include it with balance 0.

**Given** I am in the New Account modal with Bank selected
**When** I click the "Con conexión" tab
**Then** the tab stays inactive (cursor not-allowed) and surfaces a small "Available in next iteration" indicator — no PSD2 form is rendered.

**Given** I enter an invalid IBAN in the "Sin conexión" Bank form
**When** I press Save
**Then** the form shows an inline IBAN error and does not call the backend.

**Given** an organization already has an account named "Santander Operativa"
**When** I attempt to create another account with the same name in the same organization
**Then** the backend returns HTTP 409 and the modal surfaces the duplicate-name error inline.

**Given** I open the Edit Account modal for any account
**When** the modal renders
**Then** the "Datos de la cuenta" section is editable and "Conexión bancaria" is rendered as a disabled section with a small notice, no live PSD2 data is requested from the network.

**Given** I edit the Internal name and Accounting account of an existing account
**When** I press Save changes
**Then** the backend persists the new values and the row in the Accounts list reflects them immediately.

**Given** I click `Archive account` on an account with no open reconciliations
**When** I confirm the dialog
**Then** the account flips `IsActive='N'` and disappears from the default Accounts list.

**Given** I click `Archive account` on an account that has at least one open `FIN_Reconciliation`
**When** I confirm the dialog
**Then** the backend responds with HTTP 409, the UI surfaces a clear error message, and the account remains active.

**Given** I open the kebab on an account row
**When** I look at the PSD2-related entries (Edit PSD2 connection, Sync now, Manual statement import, Disconnect PSD2)
**Then** they are visible but disabled, with a tooltip indicating they are wired in T3.

## Task 3 — Wire PSD2 connection panel and Salt Edge integration into the Accounts UI

**Title (Jira):** Wire PSD2 connection panel and Salt Edge integration into the Accounts UI
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T2, existing PSD2 module
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Activate the PSD2 / Salt Edge flows in the Accounts UI built by T2. The PSD2 backend logic and the Salt Edge widget already exist in the dedicated PSD2 module — this story is **only frontend wiring**, no new backend code.
* Activate the **"Con conexión" tab** in the New Account modal for the Bank type. The tab embeds the existing PSD2 module's widget; on successful connect, the new `FIN_Financial_Account` is linked to the PSD2 connection automatically by that module.
* Activate the **"Conexión bancaria" section** inside the Edit Account modal (the disabled placeholder from T2). The live section shows: connection status, periodicity, auto-reconciliation mode, plus action buttons Re-authorize, Disconnect, Sync now — all consumed from the existing PSD2 module's APIs.
* Activate the remaining row-kebab actions on the Accounts page: **Edit PSD2 connection**, **Sync now**, **Manual statement import**, **Disconnect PSD2**. Each delegates to the corresponding endpoint of the PSD2 module.
* Render the **re-authorization warning** in the Edit Account modal when `AuthExpiresAt - now < 7 days` (a yellow banner with a "Re-autorizar" link that re-launches the widget in reconnect mode).
* Activate the Card flow in the New Account wizard once Jorge ships the credit-card PSD2 integration in the PSD2 module. If that work is not ready by the time T3 ships, the Card tile stays as a placeholder pointing to Jorge's ticket.

### Solution Design

**Frontend (Schema Forge):**

* In `NewAccountWizard.jsx` (from T2): replace the disabled "Con conexión" placeholder with the embedded PSD2 widget exported by the PSD2 module. The exact import path is resolved with the PSD2 module's maintainer; the wrapper receives `FIN_FinancialAccount_ID` (or null on creation) as the main prop and the resolved `customerId` from session.
* In `EditAccountModal.jsx` (from T2): replace the disabled "Conexión bancaria" placeholder with the live panel. The panel reads status / periodicity / `AuthExpiresAt` from the PSD2 module's GET endpoint and binds the action buttons to its POST endpoints.
* In `useAccountActions(account)` (from T2): replace the stubbed handlers (`syncNow`, `manualImport`, `disconnect`, `editPsd2`) with real implementations that call the PSD2 module's endpoints. Each handler shows a non-blocking toast on success and surfaces backend errors inline.
* The kebab entries that were disabled in T2 are now enabled and gated by `account.psd2.status` (e.g., `Disconnect PSD2` only enabled when status is `Connected` or `Expired`).
* Re-authorization banner: a small yellow strip rendered inside the Edit Account modal when the PSD2 module reports `daysUntilAuthExpires < 7`. Click on the link re-launches the widget in reconnect mode.
* Vitest covers: widget mounting with correct account id; each kebab action invoking the right PSD2 endpoint; re-auth warning rendering at the right threshold; status-driven enable/disable of each action.

**Backend:** none. This is a pure frontend integration story.

**i18n:** activate the PSD2-related keys drafted in T2 — `finance.psd2.*`, `finance.accounts.action.{syncNow,disconnectPSD2,editPSD2,manualImport}`.

**Out of scope:** new PSD2 backend logic, credit-card PSD2 association (Jorge's separate work), account detail view (T4).

### Test Cases

**Given** the PSD2 module is installed and configured with sandbox keys
**When** I open the New Account modal, choose Bank, and switch to the "Con conexión" tab
**Then** the existing PSD2 widget is mounted inside the tab and follows its own sandbox flow up to successful connect.

**Given** I complete the PSD2 connect flow successfully
**When** the widget closes
**Then** a new `FIN_Financial_Account` linked to the PSD2 connection appears in the Accounts list with status "Connected".

**Given** I open the Edit Account modal for an account whose PSD2 connection is active
**When** the modal renders
**Then** the "Conexión bancaria" section shows the current status, periodicity, and the Re-autorizar / Desconectar / Sincronizar buttons are all enabled.

**Given** I open the Edit Account modal for an account whose `AuthExpiresAt` is within 7 days
**When** the modal renders
**Then** a yellow re-authorization banner is visible with a "Re-autorizar" link that, when clicked, opens the PSD2 widget in reconnect mode.

**Given** I open the kebab on an account row with an active PSD2 connection
**When** I select `Sincronizar ahora`
**Then** the PSD2 module's sync endpoint is invoked, a non-blocking toast surfaces the sync status, and the Accounts list refreshes any balance changes.

**Given** I open the kebab on an account row with an active PSD2 connection
**When** I select `Desconectar PSD2` and confirm the dialog
**Then** the PSD2 module's disconnect endpoint is invoked, the connection status flips to `Disconnected`, and the account itself stays in the list (`IsActive='Y'`).

**Given** I open the kebab on an account row whose PSD2 connection is `Disconnected`
**When** I look at the PSD2-related entries
**Then** `Sincronizar ahora` and `Desconectar PSD2` are disabled, while `Editar conexión PSD2` is enabled and re-opens the connection widget.

**Given** the PSD2 endpoint returns an error (e.g., expired authorization)
**When** I click `Sincronizar ahora`
**Then** the UI surfaces a clear error message inline and the account row stays unchanged.

## Task 4 — Build financial account detail view (Movements + Imported statements tabs)

**Title (Jira):** Build financial account detail view with Movements and Imported statements tabs
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T1
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Build the per-account detail view rendered at `/financial-account/{id}` with three tabs: Movements (default), Reconciliation (placeholder, materialized in T6), Imported statements.
* Movements is the canonical list of `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` for the selected account, redesigned per section 3 of the functional document: drop the legacy combined "Third party / Reconciliation" column in favor of separate Contact, Description, Status columns; remove the "Uncategorized" counter from the header.
* KPI strip at the top: Current balance, Inflows (sum of last 30 days), Outflows (sum of last 30 days). The "Uncategorized" counter present in classic Etendo must NOT be shown.
* Toolbar filters: All statuses, Last 30 days, Any type, Any amount, free-text search, Export, `+ New movement`.
* Status column derived (not stored): Draft / Completed / Reconciled / Posted, following the derivation rules from section 11 of the implementation plan.
* Imported statements tab: read-only listing of `FIN_Bank_Statement` for the account with Name, Statement date, Beginning balance, Ending balance, Document status, Posted flag.
* Per-row kebab in Movements: `View detail` (active), `Unreconcile` (disabled until T8), `Post` (disabled until T8).

### Solution Design

**Schema Forge:**

* New artifact `artifacts/financial-account/` with `decisions.json` v2 declaring `layoutType: "custom"`. Registered in `tools/app-shell/src/windows/registry.js`.
* New custom window `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/financial-account/index.jsx` rendering a local Tabs strip (UI-driven, not AD tabs).
* Three tab components under `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/financial-account/`:
  * `MovimientosTab.jsx` — uses `DataTable` from `contract-ui` with a custom column config, KPI strip via a shared `KpiStrip` component, custom filter row.
  * `ExtractosImportadosTab.jsx` — reuses the existing list infrastructure pointing to the NEO Headless `bank-statement` spec, filtered by current account.
  * `ReconciliacionTab.jsx` — empty body with a placeholder message "Coming in T6".
* Status derivation extracted to a pure helper `deriveTransactionStatus(tx)` and unit-tested. Inputs: `FIN_Payment.Processed`, presence of a `FIN_Reconciliation_Line`, and the `ETBR_PostStatus` column when it exists (T8 introduces it; this ticket treats missing column as Draft/Completed/Reconciled only).
* Per-row kebab implemented with a shared `<DropdownMenu>`; `Unreconcile` and `Post` entries rendered with `disabled` flag.

**Backend:**

* Extend `FinancialAccountHandler` if the by-id `GET` requires extra response shaping (header info: name, IBAN, current balance, currency, PSD2 status if any).
* Movements listing reads from the existing NEO Headless spec for `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` (create one via `push-to-neo` if missing), filtered server-side by `FIN_FinancialAccount_ID`.
* Imported statements listing reads from the `bank-statement` spec, filtered by account.
* New i18n keys `finance.account.tab.*`, `finance.account.kpi.*`, `finance.account.movements.column.*`.

**Out of scope:** Reconciliation tab body (T6), `+ New movement` action, functional `Unreconcile` / `Post` kebab actions (T8).

### Test Cases

**Given** I click an account row on the Accounts page
**When** the detail view loads
**Then** the header shows account name, IBAN and balance; tabs Movements / Reconciliation / Imported statements are visible; Movements is selected by default.

**Given** the Movements tab is active for an account with 50 transactions
**When** the page finishes loading
**Then** the KPI strip shows Current balance, Inflows (last 30 days), Outflows (last 30 days), and the table lists the 50 transactions with columns Date, Document, Contact, Description, Status, Type, Amount, Balance, kebab — without an "Uncategorized" counter and without a combined "Third party / Reconciliation" column.

**Given** I select the type filter "Any type" → "Sale invoice"
**When** the filter is applied
**Then** only transactions of type Sale invoice are rendered and the KPI inflow/outflow are recomputed accordingly.

**Given** a transaction has an associated unprocessed `FIN_Payment`
**When** the row renders
**Then** the Status column shows "Draft".

**Given** a transaction has a processed payment but no `FIN_Reconciliation_Line`
**When** the row renders
**Then** the Status column shows "Completed".

**Given** a transaction has a `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` with `Status=Reconciled`
**When** the row renders
**Then** the Status column shows "Reconciled".

**Given** I switch to the Imported statements tab
**When** the tab loads
**Then** the table shows all `FIN_Bank_Statement` rows for that account with Name, Statement date, Beginning balance, Ending balance, Status, Posted.

**Given** I switch to the Reconciliation tab
**When** the tab loads
**Then** an empty state is rendered with a message referencing the pending implementation (T6).

## Task 5 — Deliver matching rules backend, AD window and Figma-aligned UI

**Title (Jira):** Deliver matching rules backend, AD window and Figma-aligned UI
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T1
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Deliver the Matching Rules catalog as a complete vertical slice: backend tables, AD window, NeoHandler, Schema Forge artifact, and the UI matching the Figma mockups in "PASANDO EN LIMPIO" (list + "New rule" modal).
* The engine that actually executes rules is part of T7. Rules persisted in this ticket are not yet evaluated — they are stored and listed so that T7 can pick them up.
* Enable the `Matching rules` button on the Accounts page so it navigates to the new rules screen at `/match-rule`.
* The list shows columns: Priority, Name, Affected account, Tolerance, Reconciliations (cached match count, read-only), Active (inline toggle). A banner reminds the user that rules are evaluated in ascending priority order.
* The "New rule" modal mirrors the screenshot in section 6.2 of the functional document: Name, Text condition (Contains / Starts with / Regex) + Pattern, Transaction type, Accounting account, Default third party (optional), Amount tolerance, Priority, Applies to (specific account / all), Dimensions (up to 3 stackable dropdowns), Create transaction automatically toggle.
* Inline editing on the list: Active toggle and Priority field perform a PATCH and re-sort the table.

### Solution Design

**Database (new module `com.etendoerp.bankreconciliation`):**

* Create the new runtime module `com.etendoerp.bankreconciliation` (sibling of `com.etendoerp.go`) using `/etendo:module`. AD_Module record generated with `make uuid`.
* New tables: `ETBR_MatchRule`, `ETBR_MatchRule_Dim`. Schemas documented in section 5.1 of the implementation plan. Every UUID generated with `make uuid`.
* Add a new AD_Window with its tabs and fields via the `/etendo:alter-db` webhooks.
* Run `./gradlew update.database` and commit the generated XML.

**Backend (NEO Headless):**

* Schema Forge artifact `artifacts/match-rule/` with `decisions.json` v2; spec registered via `push-to-neo`.
* New `MatchRuleHandler implements NeoHandler` (`@Named("matchRule")`) responsible for:
  * Validating `TextPattern`: when `TextCondition='R'`, compile the pattern with a timeout cap of 200 ms to reject pathological regexes. Reject on compile error (HTTP 400).
  * Validating `Priority` uniqueness within scope (per `FIN_FinancialAccount_ID` or "all accounts"). Reject duplicates with HTTP 409.
  * Returning `Priority = (current max + 10)` on `GET /match-rule/defaults`.
  * The `ETBR_MatchCount` field is read-only and exposed for display; T7 increments it when suggestions are accepted.
* JUnit covering text condition modes (`C` Contains, `S` Starts with, `R` Regex), priority validation, dimension persistence (1..3 rows), regex timeout enforcement.

**Frontend (Schema Forge):**

* Enable the navigation from the Accounts page's `Matching rules` button.
* Custom `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/match-rule/MatchRuleTable.jsx` with the inline Priority cell and Active toggle. Toggle calls `PATCH /match-rule/{id}` with `{ IsActive: 'Y' | 'N' }`. Inline Priority edit triggers an optimistic re-sort and a PATCH.
* Custom `tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/match-rule/NewRuleModal.jsx` matching the screenshot in the functional document, mounted as the create flow on the list page.
* Dimensions section renders up to 3 dropdown rows; data persists via the sub-collection POST `/match-rule/{id}/dimensions`.
* Vitest covers the modal validations, full payload submission, inline edit behavior, and Active toggle.

**i18n:** new keys `finance.rules.*` in English and Spanish.

**Out of scope:** rule evaluation against bank statement lines (T7); automatic creation of `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` from a rule (T7); cross-account rule conflict resolution UX beyond a basic 409 error.

### Test Cases

**Given** I navigate to the Matching Rules screen for the first time
**When** the page loads
**Then** the list is empty, a banner explains the ascending-priority evaluation order, and a `+ New rule` button is visible.

**Given** I open the New Rule modal and fill in a valid rule (Name = "Bank fees", condition Contains "COMMISSION", type Bank fee, accounting account, tolerance 0%, priority 10, applies to "All accounts", create transaction automatically = Y)
**When** I save
**Then** the rule is persisted in `ETBR_MatchRule`, the list refreshes and the new row appears sorted by ascending priority.

**Given** a rule with priority 10 already exists for "All accounts"
**When** I attempt to create another rule with priority 10 in the same scope
**Then** the backend returns HTTP 409 and the modal surfaces the duplicate-priority error inline.

**Given** I open the New Rule modal, set Text condition = Regex, and enter the pattern `[unclosed`
**When** I save
**Then** the backend rejects with HTTP 400 mentioning the regex compilation failure; the modal stays open with the error visible.

**Given** I select Text condition = Regex with a pathologically catastrophic pattern (e.g., `(a+)+b` against a long input)
**When** the validator runs
**Then** the compilation timeout fires and the rule is rejected with a clear error.

**Given** I add three dimension rows in the modal (Project A, Cost center 1, Campaign Q1) and save
**When** the rule is re-opened
**Then** the dimensions persist and re-render in the same order from `ETBR_MatchRule_Dim`.

**Given** an active rule is listed
**When** I toggle the Active switch off
**Then** `PATCH /match-rule/{id}` is called with `IsActive='N'` and the row is visually muted but stays in the list.

**Given** rules exist with priorities 5, 10 and 20
**When** I edit the Priority cell of the priority-20 rule to 1
**Then** the row jumps to the top and the list re-sorts in ascending priority order.

## Task 6 — Implement manual reconciliation split panel and reconcile handler

**Title (Jira):** Implement manual reconciliation split panel and reconcile handler
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T4
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Materialize the Reconciliation tab on the financial account detail view with the 50/50 split panel as described in section 5 and the "PASANDO EN LIMPIO" Figma mockups of the functional document. This is the most sensitive ticket in the module — it must wrap the standard Etendo reconciliation flow without reimplementing it.
* Left panel: unreconciled `FIN_Bank_Statement_Line` records for the current account, pre-filtered "Pending / Last 12 months", filterable by status, date, amount, and free-text search.
* Right panel: unreconciled system candidates (`FIN_FinAcc_Transaction`, `C_Invoice`, `FIN_Payment`), filterable by document type via a dropdown with options Sale invoice, Sale ticket, Sale credit notes, Bank deposit, Customer collections, Purchase invoice, Purchase ticket, Payroll, Purchase credit notes, Outgoing payments.
* Clicking a left-panel row highlights candidate matches on the right (suggested via the standard Etendo algorithm) and shows the selected extract metadata in a header above the right panel.
* Bottom action bar: Documents selected total, Remaining to reconcile, buttons Transfer, New document, Reconcile.
* The Reconcile button persists the match by calling the standard Etendo reconciliation flow (`FIN_BankStatementHandler.processStatementLine` and friends). The new module never reimplements that logic — it composes on top.
* When the user selects already-reconciled lines, the Reconcile button label and behavior switch to "Reactivate". The handler for Reactivate is wired in T8; this ticket only handles the label/state machine.
* The Automatch button at the top right of the panel stays disabled in this ticket; T7 enables it.

### Solution Design

**Frontend (shared component):**

* New shared component `tools/app-shell/src/components/contract-ui/ReconciliationSplitPanel.jsx`. Generic enough to back any "match A vs B" UX in the future; the financial account window passes the dataset configuration.
* Resizable 50/50 layout (min 30% each side). Two `DataTable` instances side-by-side, each with its own filter row.
* Status colors per row: Pending (gray), Reconciled (green), Suggested (blue), By rule (yellow, T7), With difference (red).
* Bottom action bar reads selection state from both panels; computes `Documents selected` and `Remaining to reconcile`.
* Reconcile button disabled when `selectedExtract.amount !== sum(selectedOperations.amount)` and no difference handling is allowed by configuration. Difference rules documented in section 11 of the implementation plan.
* `ReconciliacionTab.jsx` placeholder (introduced in T4) is replaced by the real implementation here.
* `+ New document` reuses the existing Etendo "Create payment" flow for the selected extract amount. `Transfer` opens the existing internal-transfer process. No new business logic.
* Vitest unit-covers the component (selection, totals, disabled states).

**Backend (com.etendoerp.go):**

* Extend `ReconciliationHandler` (`@Named("bankReconciliation")` NeoHandler) with a new action endpoint:
  * `POST /reconciliation/action/reconcileGroup` accepting `{ financialAccountId, statementLineId, operationIds: [...] }`.
  * The handler builds the `FIN_Reconciliation` / `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` rows by calling existing standard Etendo services (`FIN_BankStatementHandler`, `FIN_AddPayment`). No business logic is reimplemented.
  * Validation: all operations must belong to the same financial account; sum must match the extract amount within the configured tolerance.
  * Returns the new `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` ids and the updated balances.
* JUnit + OBBaseTest coverage for: 1:1 happy path, 1:N exact sum, 1:N with rounding tolerance, mismatched accounts (reject), already-reconciled lines (reject), period closed (reject).

**i18n:** new keys `finance.reconcile.*` in English and Spanish.

**Security:** Vigia security review mandatory — this is the first ticket to mutate money-related entities through the new UI surface.

**Out of scope:** Automatch popup (T7), rule-based suggestions (T7), deferred posting (T8), Reactivate execution (T8).

### Test Cases

**Given** an account has five unreconciled bank statement lines from the last 12 months
**When** I open the Reconciliation tab
**Then** the left panel shows the five lines pre-filtered "Pending / Last 12 months" and the right panel shows the unreconciled system operations with the type filter set to "Any".

**Given** I click an extract line of `-500,00 €`
**When** the click registers
**Then** the right-panel header shows that extract's date, description and amount in red; candidate matches are highlighted.

**Given** I select one extract line of `-500,00 €` and one system payment of `-500,00 €`
**When** the selection updates
**Then** the bottom bar shows `Documents selected: -500,00 €`, `Remaining to reconcile: 0,00 €`, and the Reconcile button is enabled.

**Given** I select one extract line of `-500,00 €` and two payments summing `-400,00 €`
**When** the selection updates
**Then** the bottom bar shows `Remaining to reconcile: -100,00 €` and the Reconcile button is disabled (until difference handling is offered).

**Given** the right panel type dropdown is set to "Sale invoice"
**When** the filter applies
**Then** only candidates of that document type are listed.

**Given** I press Reconcile on a valid 1:N match
**When** the request completes
**Then** the backend persists the `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` rows via the standard Etendo flow, both selected items disappear from the unreconciled lists, and a success toast confirms the operation.

**Given** I attempt to reconcile operations from two different financial accounts (possible only via API tampering)
**When** the request reaches the handler
**Then** the backend rejects with HTTP 400 and a clear error message.

**Given** I select already-reconciled lines
**When** the selection updates
**Then** the Reconcile button label switches to Reactivate and stays disabled (its handler is wired in T8).

## Task 7 — Implement suggested automatic reconciliation popup with rules engine

**Title (Jira):** Implement suggested automatic reconciliation popup with rules engine
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T5, T6
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Implement the "Suggested automatic reconciliation" popup triggered from the `Reconcile (N)` pill on the Accounts page and from the `Automatch` button inside the Reconciliation tab. The popup shows grouped 1:N suggestions and lets the user accept them in bulk.
* The automatch process wraps the standard Etendo matching algorithm and runs the new Match Rules engine as a second pass on lines the standard algorithm did not resolve (and that are not invoice-backed). Per section 6 of the functional document, rules never apply to invoice-backed lines.
* The popup body lists groups visually as quadrants — each group is one bank statement line + N candidate operations. Each group has a checkbox so the user can include / exclude it from the bulk reconcile.
* Rule-origin groups carry a `By rule {name}` badge and, when the rule has Create transaction automatically = Y, a `New` badge on the candidate (indicating the system will materialize the missing `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction`).
* Action buttons: Cancel, Open reconciliation (navigates to the Reconciliation tab with the same account preselected), Reconcile X groups (applies accepted groups).
* When a rule-origin group is accepted, the rule's `ETBR_MatchCount` counter is incremented so the Matching Rules list reflects accurate usage stats.
* The Automatch button in the Reconciliation tab (disabled in T6) is enabled here.

### Solution Design

**Backend (com.etendoerp.bankreconciliation):**

* New process `AutoMatchProcess.java`:
  * Step 1: invoke the standard Etendo matching algorithm on all unreconciled `FIN_Bank_Statement_Line` rows for the account.
  * Step 2: for unresolved lines that do NOT reference an invoice, invoke `ApplyMatchRulesProcess`.
  * Step 3: persist every produced candidate as an `ETBR_Match_Suggestion` row with `Origin` (`S` standard / `R` rule), `Confidence`, and a `GroupKey` linking the bank statement line to its candidates.
* New process `ApplyMatchRulesProcess.java`:
  * Iterate active `ETBR_MatchRule` rows in ascending priority.
  * Evaluate `TextCondition` / `TextPattern` against the bank statement line description, reference and counterparty fields.
  * If the rule's amount tolerance is satisfied (or no target transaction exists yet), produce a suggestion. First matching rule wins; later matches are returned as `alternatives[]` metadata.
  * If `CreateTransaction = Y` and no target transaction exists, materialize a `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` using the rule's accounting account, third party, type and dimensions from `ETBR_MatchRule_Dim`. Tag it with `ETBR_AutoCreated_From_Rule = rule.id`.
* Two new action endpoints on `ReconciliationHandler`:
  * `POST /reconciliation/action/autoMatch?financialAccountId=...` runs the process and returns `{ groups: [{ groupKey, extractLine, candidates: [...], origin, confidence, ruleName?, isNew? }] }`.
  * `POST /reconciliation/action/applySuggestions` accepts `{ groupIds: [] }` and materializes the accepted groups, delegating to the same `reconcileGroup` path introduced in T6.
* JUnit covers at minimum: standard-only matches, mixed standard + rule, conflict between two rules with the same priority, rule with regex, rule with `CreateTransaction = Y`, invoice-backed line (must not be evaluated by rules), inactive rule (must be skipped), idempotent re-run on the same dataset.

**Frontend (shared component):**

* New shared component `tools/app-shell/src/components/contract-ui/AutoMatchSuggestionModal.jsx`. Renders the 1:N quadrants from the backend response.
* Per-group checkbox, top counter ("X of Y groups"), banner "Uncheck any group to exclude it".
* Badges per group: `By rule {name}` when origin = `R`; `New` badge on candidates that will be created.
* Bottom CTA: `Reconcile X groups`. On click → `POST /reconciliation/action/applySuggestions`. On success, the pill `Reconcile (N)` on the Accounts page decrements accordingly.
* Wired from two trigger points: Accounts page row pill, and the Automatch button on the Reconciliation tab (enabled in this ticket).
* Vitest + Playwright mocked spec (`e2e/tests/flows/bank-reconciliation-automatch.mocked.spec.js`) covering the happy flow.

**i18n:** new keys `finance.reconcile.suggested.*`.

**Security:** Vigia security review mandatory — second money-mutating surface.

**Out of scope:** deferred accounting (T8), Reactivate (T8), credit card support.

### Test Cases

**Given** an account has 10 unreconciled bank statement lines, all matching system payments by amount / date / reference
**When** I click `Reconcile (10)` on the Accounts page
**Then** the popup opens with 10 suggested groups, all checked by default, with origin = Standard.

**Given** the popup is open with 6 groups
**When** I uncheck two of them and click `Reconcile 4 groups`
**Then** only the 4 selected groups are persisted; the pill on the Accounts page now reads `Reconcile (6)`.

**Given** an active rule "Bank fees" with condition Contains "COMMISSION" + Create transaction automatically = Y exists
**When** I import an extract line "COMMISSION MAINT MAY" of `-3,50 €` and open the popup
**Then** the line appears as a separate group with the badge `By rule "Bank fees"` and a `New` candidate of `-3,50 €` pointing to the rule's accounting account.

**Given** a rule's `CreateTransaction = Y` group is accepted
**When** the apply request completes
**Then** a new `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` is created with `ETBR_AutoCreated_From_Rule` set to the rule id, and the rule's `ETBR_MatchCount` is incremented by 1.

**Given** a bank statement line references an invoice (its reference matches a `C_Invoice` document number)
**When** the automatch process runs
**Then** that line is handled by the standard algorithm only; no rule is evaluated against it (verified by test).

**Given** a rule has `IsActive='N'`
**When** the automatch process runs
**Then** the inactive rule is skipped and no suggestion with its id is produced.

**Given** two rules with priorities 10 and 20 both match the same line
**When** the engine evaluates them
**Then** the priority-10 rule becomes the primary suggestion and the priority-20 rule is returned as an alternative in the group metadata.

**Given** the popup is open
**When** I click `Open reconciliation`
**Then** the application navigates to the Reconciliation tab of the financial account detail view, with the current account preselected and the same suggestions reflected in the right panel.

**Given** I run automatch twice in a row on the same dataset
**When** the second run completes
**Then** no duplicate `ETBR_Match_Suggestion` rows are created and accepted suggestions are not re-proposed.

## Task 8 — Add deferred accounting and reactivate reconciliation flow

**Title (Jira):** Add deferred accounting and reactivate reconciliation flow
**Type:** Story
**Parent epic:** ETP-3504
**Depends on:** T6
**Branch:** `feature/ETP-XXXX`
**Commit prefix:** `Feature ETP-XXXX:`

### Issue Description

* Implement the deferred accounting flow described in section 7 of the functional document: no transaction is posted until it reaches the Reconciled state, and posting happens either via a scheduled batch or via a manual button. Posted reconciliations cannot be unposted directly — they must go through Reactivate.
* Add the `ETBR_PostStatus` column to `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` (`P` Pending, `D` Done, `F` Failed) and enforce the state machine in the handler.
* Implement `PostReconciledProcess`: a batch that selects `Status=Reconciled` + `ETBR_PostStatus='P'` lines, groups them by reconciliation header, posts each header in its own OBDal transaction using the existing Etendo `AcctServer.post()`. All-or-nothing per header; errors mark the lines as `F` and the batch continues with the next header.
* Configure the scheduler with a configurable frequency (system preference `ETBR_PostFrequency`, default "Every hour"). Expose a manual `Post` button on the module configuration screen and in the Reconciliation tab kebab.
* Implement `ReactivateReconciliationProcess` as a thin wrapper that delegates to the existing "Reactivate Reconciliation" flow shipped by the Payment Removal module — never reimplement that logic.
* Wire Reactivate from two surfaces: the Reconciliation tab (T6 already prepared the `Reactivate` label) and the Movements tab kebab (`Unreconcile` on `P`, `Reactivate` on `D`).
* Enforce that Posted (`D`) lines cannot be mutated: updates to amount / date on the underlying `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` must be rejected with HTTP 409.

### Solution Design

**Database (com.etendoerp.bankreconciliation):**

* Add `ETBR_PostStatus CHAR(1)` to `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` via the standard `modifiedTables/` XML mechanism. Default `P` for rows created by a reconcile action.
* New AD_Preference `ETBR_PostFrequency` (default `"Every hour"`), referenced by the scheduler.

**Backend processes:**

* `PostReconciledProcess.java`:
  * Select `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` where `ETBR_PostStatus='P'` and the parent header is `Reconciled`.
  * Group by `FIN_Reconciliation_ID` (one OBDal transaction per header).
  * For each line, call existing Etendo `AcctServer.post()` on the underlying `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` / `FIN_Payment`.
  * On success → set `ETBR_PostStatus='D'`.
  * On error → roll back that header, mark its lines `F`, log the cause to `AD_Process_Log`, continue with the next header.
  * Scheduled by AD_Process_Schedule using `ETBR_PostFrequency`. Manual invocation calls the same process via an action endpoint.
* `ReactivateReconciliationProcess.java`:
  * Wraps the existing Payment Removal "Reactivate Reconciliation" flow. Behavior: un-post first when `D`, then un-reconcile, in a single OBDal transaction.
  * Refuse the operation when the accounting period is closed; surface a clear error.
* Extend `ReconciliationHandler` with action endpoints:
  * `POST /reconciliation/action/postReconciled` → runs PostReconciledProcess for the current account (or globally).
  * `POST /reconciliation/action/reactivate` → runs ReactivateReconciliationProcess for the supplied reconciliation line ids.
* State-machine enforcement also in `ReconciliationHandler.afterHandle()` for CRUD endpoints:
  * Reject `PUT/DELETE` on a `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` whose corresponding `FIN_Reconciliation_Line.ETBR_PostStatus='D'` with HTTP 409.

**Frontend (Schema Forge):**

* Add a `Post` button on the module configuration screen (likely under `pages/SettingsPage.jsx` Finance section) and as a kebab option in the Reconciliation tab.
* Movements tab status derivation extended to differentiate `Reconciled` (`P`) vs `Posted` (`D`) visually (different chip color and label).
* Reconciliation tab: wire the `Reactivate` label (prepared in T6) to `POST /reconciliation/action/reactivate`. Confirmation modal warns about un-posting + un-reconciling.
* Movements tab kebab: `Unreconcile` (for `P` lines) and `Reactivate` (for `D` lines) both call the same endpoint; the handler resolves the action based on `ETBR_PostStatus`.
* Vitest + JUnit + OBBaseTest covering the cycle reconcile → post → reactivate → re-post.

**i18n:** new keys `finance.reconcile.action.post`, `finance.reconcile.action.reactivate`, `finance.reconcile.confirm.reactivate`.

**Security:** Vigia security review mandatory — closes the loop on money-mutating operations.

**Out of scope:** complex multi-currency posting; advanced period-close rules beyond the existing Etendo behavior; manual unposting outside of Reactivate (intentionally disallowed by design).

### Test Cases

**Given** I reconcile a bank statement line against a payment in the Reconciliation tab
**When** the operation completes
**Then** the resulting `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` has `Status=Reconciled` and `ETBR_PostStatus='P'`, and the Movements tab shows the related transaction as "Reconciled" (not Posted).

**Given** at least one `FIN_Reconciliation_Line` is in `ETBR_PostStatus='P'`
**When** I click the manual `Post` button
**Then** `PostReconciledProcess` runs, the line is posted via standard Etendo accounting, `ETBR_PostStatus` flips to `D`, and the Movements tab shows "Posted".

**Given** the AD_Preference `ETBR_PostFrequency` is set to "Every hour"
**When** the scheduler tick fires
**Then** all pending lines for all accounts are processed automatically without user interaction.

**Given** a posting fails for one reconciliation header (e.g., missing accounting configuration)
**When** the batch runs
**Then** that header's lines are marked `F`, an error entry is written to `AD_Process_Log`, and the next header is processed normally — the batch does not abort.

**Given** a posted (`D`) reconciliation line exists
**When** a `PUT` is attempted on its underlying `FIN_FinAcc_Transaction` to change the amount
**Then** the backend returns HTTP 409 with a clear "Posted transactions are immutable" message.

**Given** a posted (`D`) reconciliation line exists
**When** I select it in the Reconciliation tab and click `Reactivate`
**Then** a confirmation modal appears; on confirm, the entry is unposted then unreconciled atomically, the underlying transaction returns to Completed, and the line disappears from the reconciliation.

**Given** the accounting period of a posted line is closed
**When** I attempt to Reactivate it
**Then** the backend rejects the operation with a clear error referencing the closed period; the line stays posted.

**Given** a reconciled-only (`P`) line exists
**When** I open its kebab in the Movements tab and click `Unreconcile`
**Then** the same reactivate flow is invoked; the line returns to Completed and disappears from any active reconciliation.

**Given** I reactivate a posted line and then re-reconcile + re-post it
**When** the cycle completes
**Then** the resulting accounting entries are identical to the originals (idempotency confirmed) and no duplicates exist.
