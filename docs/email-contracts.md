# Email Contracts Guide

Email contracts are the only supported way to send transactional email from Etendo Go. A contract is a server-side agreement between a product workflow and the email executor. It describes authorization, recipient resolution, variable resolution, throttling, idempotency, audit, and provider behavior.

Use this guide when adding or changing a contract.

## Contract Descriptor

Every contract must define these fields.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Stable kebab-case contract name, for example `reset-password` |
| `version` | Yes | Contract schema version, starting at `v1` |
| `template` | Yes | Provider template identifier or internal renderer key |
| `enabled` | Yes | Default enabled state; kill switches can override it |
| `description` | Yes | Short business purpose |
| `caller` | Yes | Allowed source, such as `frontend`, `system`, `support`, or `admin` |
| `authorization` | Yes | Role, process, window, record, tenant, and organization checks |
| `recipient` | Yes | Server-side recipient source and validation rules |
| `variables` | Yes | Allowed variable names, types, sources, and required flags |
| `replyTo` | Yes | Disabled by default or explicit allowlist policy |
| `links` | If links exist | Link generator, expiry, host policy, and token policy |
| `throttle` | Yes | Per-contract abuse limits |
| `idempotency` | Yes | Key strategy and duplicate window |
| `audit` | Yes | Events and redaction rules |
| `suppression` | Yes | Recipient/domain suppression behavior |
| `killSwitch` | Yes | Global, tenant, and contract disable behavior |
| `edgeCases` | Yes | At least three edge cases with expected outcomes |

## Request Contract

The browser sends a command to Etendo Go:

```http
POST /sws/neo/email-contracts/{contractName}/send
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "recordId": "E2F7A13B...",
  "intent": "send-document",
  "idempotencyKey": "sales-invoice-send:E2F7A13B:send:v1"
}
```

The browser must not send provider API keys, sender addresses, raw templates, or arbitrary provider payloads.

For the app-shell document send flow, `SendDocumentModal` posts only the contract command to `/sws/neo/email-contracts/{document-contract}/send`, such as `sales-invoice-send`, `sales-order-send`, or `sales-quotation-send`. The UI must not include `to`, `template`, `data`, `subject`, `body`, sender, Reply-To, or provider metadata in that request; those values are resolved by the server-side contract.

For auth email flows, the browser does not send an email contract command at all. It calls `/sws/go/register`, `/sws/go/password-reset/request`, `/sws/go/password-reset/confirm`, or `/sws/go/change-password`; Etendo Go builds the `new-account`, `reset-password`, `password-changed`, and `environment-ready` commands server-side from trusted account/onboarding records.

## Response Contract

Recommended executor response:

```json
{
  "status": "SENT",
  "contract": "sales-invoice-send",
  "version": "v1",
  "requestId": "req-8d7f0a",
  "auditId": "audit-7bc0",
  "duplicate": false,
  "retryAfterSeconds": null
}
```

Allowed statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `SENT` | Provider accepted the send |
| `DUPLICATE` | Idempotency found an equivalent send in the duplicate window |
| `THROTTLED` | A contract throttle limit blocked the send |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Authenticated user cannot execute the contract or access the record |
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Command, record state, or variables failed validation |
| `NO_RECIPIENT` | The contract could not resolve a valid recipient |
| `SUPPRESSED` | Recipient or domain is suppressed |
| `KILL_SWITCHED` | Global, tenant, provider, or contract switch disabled sending |
| `PROVIDER_FAILED` | Provider call failed after validation and audit |

## Recipient Policies

Default policy: resolve the recipient from trusted server data.

Allowed recipient sources:

| Source | Allowed For | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `account-owner` | Auth/account flows | Uses account user email from server records |
| `business-partner-contact` | Document flows | Uses the selected contact on the document or business partner |
| `responsible-user` | Internal alerts | Uses the server-side assigned user |
| `caller-provided` | Admin/support only | Requires explicit contract, role check, reason, validation, and audit |

Reject any command that tries to override recipient, sender, Reply-To, template, or provider metadata outside the contract schema.

## Reply-To Policy

Reply-To is disabled unless the contract explicitly enables it.

When enabled:

- it must be derived from a trusted server record or allowlisted support mailbox
- it must be syntactically valid
- it must not change the sender identity
- it must be recorded in audit
- it must not permit tenant domain spoofing

## Template and Variable Policy

Variables must be allowlisted and typed. HTML variables require sanitizer policy.

| Type | Rule |
|------|------|
| `string` | Escape by default before rendering |
| `date` | Format server-side or pass a typed value plus locale |
| `currency` | Include amount and ISO currency code; avoid preformatted ambiguous strings when possible |
| `url` | Generate server-side; allowlisted hosts only |
| `html` | Only for controlled contracts; sanitize and audit sanitizer outcome |

Document notification contracts should use the default document payload unless a legacy provider template requires a specific alias:

| Variable | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `name` | Business partner/contact display name |
| `document_type` | Contract-defined document label |
| `document_number` | Document number from the trusted record |
| `download_link` | Server-generated document URL |

Amounts and document-specific aliases are compatibility exceptions, not the default. For example, `sales-invoice-send` still emits `amount` and `invoice_number` because the existing invoice provider template expects them. `sales-order-send` and `sales-quotation-send` use only the default document variables.

## Initial Contracts

### `reset-password`

Purpose: send a password reset link without revealing account existence.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "reset-password",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "reset-password",
  "caller": ["public-auth-flow", "system"],
  "recipient": { "source": "account-owner" },
  "variables": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "source": "user.displayName", "required": true },
    "link": { "type": "url", "source": "resetToken.url", "required": true }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": false },
  "idempotency": { "key": "reset-password:{tenantId}:{userId}:active-token:v1", "windowSeconds": 900 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Unknown email returns neutral success without revealing account existence.
- Disabled or inactive accounts return the same neutral request response and do not receive a token.
- Provider failure, throttling, or kill-switch suppression does not change the neutral request response.
- Missing, expired, or already-used reset tokens are rejected by `/sws/go/password-reset/confirm`.
- A valid reset token can be used once; the password is changed, reset token fields are cleared/consumed, and the platform session token is cleared.

### `new-account`

Purpose: notify users immediately after successful local account registration.

Required edge cases:

- Registration commits before the email attempt; provider failure is audited and must not roll back account creation.
- Inactive account records are rejected by the contract resolver.
- Duplicate registration email commands return `DUPLICATE`.

Email verification is not part of the local account flow. There are no verification fields and login/onboarding is not gated by email verification because SSO is the next authentication step.

### `environment-ready`

Purpose: notify users after onboarding successfully commits and the environment is ready.

Required edge cases:

- Onboarding fails or rolls back: do not send the email.
- Onboarding commits and the provider fails: audit the failure but keep onboarding success.
- Duplicate completion for the same environment/client id returns `DUPLICATE`.

### `password-changed`

Purpose: notify the account owner after an authenticated local password change.

Required edge cases:

- Wrong current password rejects the request and sends no email.
- Valid change rotates the platform session token and sends the notice best-effort.
- Provider failure is audited and must not roll back the password change.

### `login-alert`

Purpose: notify a user about a security-relevant login event.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "login-alert",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "login-alert",
  "caller": ["system"],
  "recipient": { "source": "account-owner" },
  "variables": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "source": "user.displayName", "required": true },
    "ip": { "type": "string", "source": "loginEvent.ip", "required": false },
    "date": { "type": "date", "source": "loginEvent.occurredAt", "required": true }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": false },
  "idempotency": { "key": "login-alert:{tenantId}:{userId}:{loginEventId}:v1", "windowSeconds": 86400 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Missing IP or device metadata uses safe fallback text and logs missing metadata.
- High-volume attempts throttle per account and source IP.
- User has disabled security emails only if policy allows opt-out; mandatory alerts ignore preference.

Current status: the contract remains registered but login does not trigger it yet. Login alerts are deferred until the SSO and risk-policy model exists.

### `sales-invoice-send`

Purpose: send an invoice/document notification to the recipient resolved from the document.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "sales-invoice-send",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "invoice",
  "caller": ["frontend"],
  "authorization": {
    "windowAccess": "sales-invoice",
    "recordAccess": "recordId",
    "requiresReadableDocument": true
  },
  "recipient": { "source": "business-partner-contact", "recordId": "request.recordId" },
  "variables": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "source": "businessPartner.name", "required": true },
    "document_type": { "type": "string", "source": "contract.documentType", "required": true },
    "document_number": { "type": "string", "source": "invoice.documentNo", "required": true },
    "invoice_number": { "type": "string", "source": "invoice.documentNo", "required": true },
    "amount": { "type": "currency", "source": "invoice.grandTotal", "required": true },
    "download_link": { "type": "url", "source": "documentDownload.url", "required": true }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": false },
  "idempotency": { "key": "sales-invoice-send:{tenantId}:{recordId}:v1", "windowSeconds": 3600 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Caller lacks record access: return `UNAUTHORIZED` and do not reveal record details.
- Document has no contact email: return `NO_RECIPIENT`.
- Document status is not allowed for sending: return `VALIDATION_FAILED`.

### `sales-order-send`

Purpose: send a sales order document notification to the recipient resolved from the order.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "sales-order-send",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "document",
  "caller": ["frontend"],
  "authorization": {
    "windowAccess": "sales-order",
    "recordAccess": "recordId",
    "requiresReadableDocument": true
  },
  "recipient": { "source": "business-partner-contact", "recordId": "request.recordId" },
  "variables": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "source": "businessPartner.name", "required": true },
    "document_type": { "type": "string", "source": "contract.documentType", "required": true },
    "document_number": { "type": "string", "source": "order.documentNo", "required": true },
    "download_link": { "type": "url", "source": "documentDownload.url", "required": true }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": false },
  "idempotency": { "key": "sales-order-send:{tenantId}:{recordId}:v1", "windowSeconds": 3600 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Caller lacks record access: return `UNAUTHORIZED` and do not reveal record details.
- Order has no contact email: return `NO_RECIPIENT`.
- Record is not a sales order: return `VALIDATION_FAILED`.

### `sales-quotation-send`

Purpose: send a sales quotation document notification to the recipient resolved from the quotation.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "sales-quotation-send",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "document",
  "caller": ["frontend"],
  "authorization": {
    "windowAccess": "sales-quotation",
    "recordAccess": "recordId",
    "requiresReadableDocument": true
  },
  "recipient": { "source": "business-partner-contact", "recordId": "request.recordId" },
  "variables": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "source": "businessPartner.name", "required": true },
    "document_type": { "type": "string", "source": "contract.documentType", "required": true },
    "document_number": { "type": "string", "source": "quotation.documentNo", "required": true },
    "download_link": { "type": "url", "source": "documentDownload.url", "required": true }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": false },
  "idempotency": { "key": "sales-quotation-send:{tenantId}:{recordId}:v1", "windowSeconds": 3600 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Caller lacks record access: return `UNAUTHORIZED` and do not reveal record details.
- Quotation has no contact email: return `NO_RECIPIENT`.
- Record is not a sales quotation: return `VALIDATION_FAILED`.

### `support-custom-email`

Purpose: controlled support/admin email for exceptional workflows.

This is the only permitted custom email shape. It must not be exposed to general users.

Descriptor sketch:

```json
{
  "name": "support-custom-email",
  "version": "v1",
  "template": "custom",
  "caller": ["support", "admin"],
  "authorization": {
    "roles": ["Support Admin", "System Administrator"],
    "requiresReason": true
  },
  "recipient": {
    "source": "caller-provided",
    "validateEmail": true,
    "domainPolicy": "allow-or-review"
  },
  "variables": {
    "subject": { "type": "string", "source": "request.subject", "required": true },
    "body": { "type": "html", "source": "request.body", "required": true, "sanitizer": "strict-email-html" }
  },
  "replyTo": { "enabled": true, "source": "allowlisted-support-mailbox" },
  "idempotency": { "key": "support-custom-email:{tenantId}:{recipientHash}:{subjectHash}:v1", "windowSeconds": 600 }
}
```

Required edge cases:

- Non-support user executes the command: return `UNAUTHORIZED`.
- Body contains unsafe HTML: return `VALIDATION_FAILED` or send sanitized output according to policy, and audit the sanitizer result.
- Missing reason: return `VALIDATION_FAILED`.

## Versioning Rules

- Add a new version when request shape, authorization, recipient source, variable semantics, or throttle behavior changes.
- Keep old versions only while clients still need them.
- Deprecate a version by documenting the replacement and adding observability for remaining usage.
- Do not change a contract in place when it can cause a client to send a different recipient, template, or set of variables.

## Review Checklist

Before merging a contract change:

- Contract entry exists in this guide.
- At least three edge cases are listed.
- Backend tests cover authorization, recipient resolution, invalid recipient, idempotency, throttling, provider failure, audit, and Reply-To policy.
- UI maps all executor statuses used by the contract.
- Provider secret values are not present in code, docs, tests, fixtures, screenshots, or frontend bundles.
- Operations runbook and metrics are updated when behavior changes.
- Observability tests or verification scripts prove the contract emits redacted events for success, validation failure, throttle, duplicate, suppression/kill switch, and provider failure outcomes.
