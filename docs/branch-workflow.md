# Branch & Worktree Workflow

Rules for branch management, worktree isolation, and merging in the Schema Forge pipeline.

## Worktree Isolation (MANDATORY)

Every task runs in an isolated git worktree. No exceptions.
The worktree branch is created FROM the current branch, and PRs target that same branch.

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git worktree add .worktrees/feat-<task-name> -b feat/<task-name>
```

All agents work ONLY in that worktree — never in the main repo.
The coordinator creates the worktree and passes the path to each agent.

**Worktree branches are LOCAL ONLY.** They are never pushed to remote.

### After All Phases Approve (Local Merge)

1. Coordinator switches to the parent branch: `git checkout feature/ETP-XXXX`
2. Merge the worktree branch: `git merge feat/<task-name>` (preserves full commit history)
3. Clean up: `git worktree remove .worktrees/feat-<task-name> && git branch -d feat/<task-name>`

On rejection: DEV fixes in the SAME worktree, cycle restarts from the rejecting phase.

## Parallelization

- Independent tasks → parallel worktrees
- Within a task → sequential pipeline

## Epic Branch Model (MANDATORY)

All feature work branches from and merges back to the **current epic branch**. The epic branch is the integration point for related features.

```
develop  (protected — manual merge only)
  └── epic/ETP-3504  (current epic)
        ├── feature/ETP-XXXX  →  PR targets epic/ETP-3504
        ├── feature/ETP-YYYY  →  PR targets epic/ETP-3504
        └── ...
```

### Hierarchy and merge rules

| Merge | Who | How |
|-------|-----|-----|
| `feature → epic` | Agents (via PR) | Automated — agents create PRs targeting the epic branch |
| `epic → develop` | **Human only** | Manual, under supervision — agents **NEVER** do this |
| `develop → main` | **Human only** | Manual — agents **NEVER** do this |

### Key rules

- **Features branch FROM the current epic** and PRs **target the epic**, not `develop`.
- **Agents NEVER merge to `develop` or `main`.** This is always a manual, supervised operation.
- **NEVER target `main` directly.** The highest allowed PR target for agents is the current epic branch.
- **NEVER use squash merge.** Always use regular merge (`--merge`) to preserve full commit history. Squash discards individual commits and breaks traceability.
- **Always assign the PR to the current user.**
- **GitHub usernames must be stored in auto-memory** (not committed). On first interaction, look up the current user's GitHub username and any known reviewers, and save them to auto-memory for future use. **CRITICAL:** Before ANY GitHub operation, read the `github-usernames.md` file from the auto-memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/github-usernames.md` — use the absolute path, NEVER a path relative to the project root). NEVER assume, hardcode, or guess a username — if no username is stored, ask the user and save it immediately.

## New Feature Branch Policy (MANDATORY)

When the user requests a new task while on a feature branch, the coordinator MUST ask:
1. **What is the new task?**
2. **Does it depend on changes in the current feature branch?**

Based on the answer:
- **Independent task →** Create new branch from the current epic (with `git pull` first to update)
- **Dependent task →** Create new branch from the current feature branch

## Branch Safety (MANDATORY)

When Schema Forge is on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/ETP-3505`), the target module repository (e.g., `com.etendoerp.go`) **MUST** be on the same branch. This prevents accidental commits to `main` or `develop` in the module. Always verify both repos are on matching branches before generating or committing code.
