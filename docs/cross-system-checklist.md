### Grid View (3.6–3.7)
- **3.6:** Achieved for 38/39 windows. The sort button (ArrowUpDown icon) is in `ListView.jsx` (lines 206-256) on the right side of the filter bar. Opens a sort popover with all columns, ascending/descending toggle, and "clear sort". **Exception:** `purchase-invoice` uses a fully custom `PurchaseInvoiceListView` (`tools/app-shell/src/windows/custom/purchase-invoice/index.jsx`) that bypasses `ListView` entirely — no sort button, no filter bar, no view mode toggle.
- **3.7:** Fixed. Added `RefreshCw` button in `ListView.jsx` (after sort button) wired to `hook.refresh()`. Translation keys added: `"refresh"` → "Refresh" / "Actualizar". Applies to all 38 windows using ListView.

### Form Fields (4.3, 4.4, 8.3, 8.7)
- **4.3:** Achieved. Required fields are correctly marked with a red `*` asterisk. The pipeline faithfully propagates the DB `ismandatory` flag: `extract-fields.js` (line 353) reads `ismandatory` from `AD_Column`, `resolve-curated.js` (line 189) maps it to `required`, `generate-frontend.js` (line 181) emits `required: true` in field configs, and `EntityForm.jsx` renders `<span className="text-red-500 ml-0.5">*</span>` next to the label. All 1275 generated form fields across all windows correctly reflect their DB mandatory status.
- **4.4:** Achieved. **Fixed 2026-04-10.** Removed `f.required` asterisk from the checkbox renderer in `EntityForm.jsx` (line 541). Boolean fields always have `ismandatory='Y'` in AD because they can't be NULL, but the `*` is semantically incorrect for a checkbox that already has a default value. Fix applied in the component (inside the `if (f.type === 'checkbox')` block) — no generator change needed.
- **8.3:** Achieved. Read-only fields have clearly differentiated appearance through multiple visual cues in `EntityForm.jsx`: (1) Labels use `text-muted-foreground` (dimmed gray) instead of `text-foreground` for read-only FK fields (lines 551, 589, 637); (2) Input fields get `disabled` attribute plus `className="bg-muted/50"` (gray background) for text/search/selector/dependent types (lines 554, 592, 640, 794); (3) Textareas get `bg-muted/50 cursor-default` (line 773); (4) Checkboxes get `disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50` (line 518); (5) Select dropdowns get `disabled` (line 738). The `*` required indicator is also suppressed for read-only fields on select, textarea, and standard input types via `f.required && !isReadOnly` checks (lines 733, 759, 785).
- **8.7:** Achieved. No fields without labels or orphan fields. Every field in `EntityForm.jsx` gets a label via the three-tier resolution chain at line 496: `const label = f.label ?? t(f.column) ?? f.key`. Of 1275 generated form field definitions, 631 (49.5%) have an explicit `label` property from decisions.json; the remaining 644 resolve through `t(f.column)` (i18n dictionary lookup by AD column name) or fall back to the camelCase `f.key` (e.g., `searchKey`, `transactionDate`). The fallback to `f.key` ensures no field can ever render without a visible label. No orphan fields were found — every field definition includes `key`, `column`, and `type` as minimum properties.

### Language / i18n (2.x)

**Architecture overview:** The app uses a custom i18n system (no react-i18next/next-intl). `LocaleProvider` at `tools/app-shell/src/i18n/LocaleProvider.jsx` loads `en_US.json` or `es_ES.json` from `tools/app-shell/src/locales/`. Three hooks resolve labels: `useLabel()` (field labels by AD column name), `useUI()` (generic UI strings from `genericLabels`), `useMenuLabel()` (window/menu/tab names from `windows`, `menus`, `ui` sections). Locale persists via `localStorage` key `schema-forge-locale`.

- **2.2.5 (Tabs and sections):** Achieved. **Reviewed 2026-04-10:** All sub-issues fixed. `DetailView.jsx` now wraps tab labels with `tMenu(tab.label)` (primary: line ~887, secondary: line ~974). Add buttons use `ui('addEntity', { label: tMenu(...) })` and Detail text uses `ui('entityDetail', { label: tMenu(...) })`. Both locale files have `ui.addEntity` ("+ Add {label}" / "+ Agregar {label}") and `ui.entityDetail` ("{label} Detail" / "Detalle de {label}"). Generator still emits hardcoded English tab label strings but translation happens at runtime in the component.

- **2.2.1 (Column headers):** Achieved. `DataTable.jsx` line 762 resolves column headers via `const colLabel = t(col.column) ?? col.label ?? col.key` where `t = useLabel()`. This looks up `dictionary.fields[columnName].label` from the locale file first, then falls back to the static `col.label` from the generator, then to the camelCase key. Both `en_US.json` and `es_ES.json` have 16,000+ field entries. The same resolution chain is used in inline add rows (lines 332, 341, 358, 414, 432).

- **2.2.2 (Field labels):** Achieved. `EntityForm.jsx` line 496Ventas / Cobro / 1000394

 resolves labels via `const label = f.label ?? t(f.column) ?? f.key` -- identical three-tier chain. The `useLabel()` hook also supports `labelOverrides` from `decisions.json` (per-window, per-locale overrides) as the highest-priority source. Field labels in both grid and form resolve from the same locale dictionary, ensuring consistency.

- **2.2.4 (Action buttons):** Achieved for core buttons. All primary action buttons use `useUI()` keys that are translated in both locale files: `ui('newRecord')` = "New"/"Nuevo", `ui('save')` = "Save"/"Guardar", `ui('cancel')` = "Cancel"/"Cancelar", `ui('delete')` = "Delete"/"Eliminar", `ui('print')` = "Print"/"Imprimir", `ui('filter')` = "Filter..."/"Filtrar...", `ui('clearAllFilters')`, `ui('cancelEsc')`, etc. Minor gaps: `EntityForm.jsx` has hardcoded "Searching..." (line 223), `"No results for"` (line 229), and `"Search {label}..."` placeholders (lines 33, 165, 420) that are not routed through `useUI()`. Custom components like `PurchaseOrderTopbar.jsx` have hardcoded English strings ("Delivery Status", "Invoice Status"), and `PurchaseInvoiceTopbar.jsx` has hardcoded "Paid" and "Pending".

- **2.2.5 (Tabs and sections):** Not achieved. Tab labels in `DetailView.jsx` (line 887: `{tab.label}`) are rendered directly from the props without any i18n lookup. The tab labels originate from the generator (`cli/src/generate-frontend.js` lines 543, 549-555, 597-604) as hardcoded English strings such as "Lines", "Tax", "Basic Discounts", "Payment Plan", "Accounting", "Landed Cost". Although the locale files have a `tabs` section with Spanish translations (e.g., `es_ES.json` has `"Lines": {"label": "Lineas"}`), the `DetailView` component never calls `tMenu()` or any i18n function on tab labels. The `useMenuLabel()` hook is imported in `DetailView.jsx` but only used for breadcrumb segments (line 523), not for tab labels. The "Others" tab does translate correctly via `ui('others')` (line 499). Fix needed: wrap `tab.label` with `tMenu(tab.label)` in `DetailView.jsx` at lines 800 and 887. Additionally, `"+ Add {detailLabel || 'Lines'}"` (line 1024) and `"+ Add {st.label}"` (line 1340) use hardcoded "Add" prefix that is not translated. The `"{st.label} Detail"` text (line 1228) is also hardcoded English.

- **2.2.6 (Breadcrumbs and window titles):** Achieved. `ListView.jsx` line 36 resolves the window title via `const label = tMenu(entityLabel) || entityLabel || entity` which looks up `ui[key] ?? menus[key] ?? windows[key]` from the locale dict. Breadcrumbs in both `ListView.jsx` (line 114) and `DetailView.jsx` (line 523) split the breadcrumb string by " / " and map each segment through `tMenu()`. The locale files have translations for window names (e.g., `es_ES.json menus["Purchase Order"] = "Pedido"`) and categories (e.g., `menus["Purchases"] = "Compras"`). The generator emits breadcrumbs like `'Purchases / Purchase Order'` which get correctly translated segment by segment at runtime.

- **2.6 ("New X" buttons):** Partially achieved. The primary "New" button in `ListView.jsx` (line 302) renders `ui('newRecord')` which is simply "New" / "Nuevo" -- no entity name is appended, so there is no mixed-language issue for the main button. However, the inline "Add" buttons in `DetailView.jsx` DO have a mixed-language problem: `"+ Add {detailLabel || 'Lines'}"` (line 1024) and `"+ Add {st.label}"` (line 1340) use a hardcoded English "Add" prefix concatenated with an untranslated entity label. In Spanish mode this would render as "+ Add Lineas" (mixed). Fix needed: create a `genericLabels.addEntity` key like `"+ Add {entity}"` / `"+ Agregar {entity}"` and pass the translated tab label through `tMenu()`.

- **2.7 (Form/grid label consistency):** Achieved. Both `DataTable.jsx` (grid) and `EntityForm.jsx` (form) use the same `useLabel()` hook from `tools/app-shell/src/i18n/useLabel.js`, which calls `resolveLabel(dictionary, columnName, langOverrides)`. The resolution chain is identical: `langOverrides[columnName] ?? dictionary.fields[columnName].label ?? null`, with fallback to the static `col.label`/`f.label` and then the camelCase key. Since both components resolve labels from the same locale dictionary using the same column names, field labels are structurally guaranteed to match between grid and form views.

### Breadcrumb & Window Title (1.4-1.6)
- **1.4:** Achieved. **Reviewed 2026-04-10:** All 33 windows accessible from the sidebar menu have breadcrumb defined. The 10 windows without breadcrumb are excluded from this checklist because they are **not present in `tools/app-shell/src/menu.json`** — no user can navigate to them from the sidebar. These are skeleton/unfinished windows that have `contract.json` but no `decisions.json` and were never fully processed through the pipeline. Excluded windows: `bom-production`, `commission`, `commission-payment`, `cost-adjustment`, `landed-cost`, `manage-requisitions`, `packing`, `requisition`, `stock-reservation`, `warehouse-picking-list`.
- **1.5:** Achieved. Both `ListView.jsx` (line 114) and `DetailView.jsx` (line 523) translate breadcrumb segments using `tMenu()`: `breadcrumb.split(' / ').map(s => tMenu(s.trim())).join(' / ')`. The `useMenuLabel()` hook (`tools/app-shell/src/i18n/useMenuLabel.js`) looks up each segment in `dictionary.ui`, `dictionary.menus`, and `dictionary.windows` sections. Spanish translations confirmed in `tools/app-shell/src/locales/es_ES.json` for all breadcrumb category segments (Sales=Ventas, Purchases=Compras, Warehouse=Almacen, Inventory=Inventario, People=Personas, Reference=Referencia, Accounting=Contabilidad) and all window name segments (Sales Order=Pedido de venta, Sales Invoice=Factura (Cliente), etc.). Applies only to the 20 windows that define breadcrumbs.
- **1.6:** Achieved. In `ListView`, the title is derived from `entityLabel` passed through `tMenu()`: `const label = tMenu(entityLabel) || entityLabel || entity` (line 36). In `DetailView`, the main title shows the document identifier (e.g., document number) via `titleField`; the breadcrumb below shows the translated window context. All `entityLabel` values have corresponding translations in the locale files.

### DOCS and NOTES sections (10.4)
- **10.4:** Achieved. **Fixed 2026-04-10.** All transactional windows now have `relatedDocuments: true` and `notesField: "description"` (or equivalent). Full list: sales-order, sales-invoice, goods-shipment, return-from-customer, payment-in, payment-out, sales-quotation, purchase-order, purchase-invoice, goods-receipt, return-material-receipt, return-to-vendor (`notesField: "returnReason"`), return-to-vendor-shipment. physical-inventory excluded by design (not a document chain). return-to-vendor and return-to-vendor-shipment also ran the full pipeline (extract → NEO → generate) for the first time. Also fixed `schema-api.js` to resolve curated schema from `decisions.json + schema-raw.json` when `schema-curated.json` doesn't exist (Schema Inspector support for modern windows).
