## 2026-03-13 — push-to-neo entity matching fails for curated names

**Context:** Pushing Sales Order to NEO Headless via `push-to-neo.js`.
**Problem:** Step 3 (field visibility update) failed for all 63 fields with "no entity" error. The contract uses curated entity names (`order`, `orderLine`) but `PopulateSpec` creates entities with AD tab names (`Header`, `Lines`). The matching logic only tried `tabId` (null in contract) and `entityName` (no match).
**Fix:** Added tableName-based fallback in `push-to-neo.js`. Three-level matching: tabId -> name -> tableName. Commit `1343db6`.
**Status:** Fixed.

## [2026-03-18] NEO Headless: List reference columns return raw code without $identifier

**Issue:** Columns with AD_Reference type "List" (e.g., DeliveryViaRule, DeliveryRule, PriorityRule, DocStatus) are returned by the NEO API as raw list codes (e.g., `"P"`, `"A"`, `"5"`, `"CO"`) without a corresponding `$_identifier` field. FK columns (TableDir/Table/Search) correctly return `fieldName$_identifier`.

**Impact:** In the UI, these fields display the internal code instead of the user-facing label ("P" instead of "Pickup Delivery", "CO" instead of "Complete", etc.).

**Expected:** NEO Headless should look up `AD_Ref_List.Name` for List-type columns and include it as `fieldName$_identifier` in the API response, consistent with FK field behavior.

**Workaround:** Mark `documentStatus` as `form: false` so it doesn't appear in the form (the status badge uses it from API data directly). Other list fields (deliveryMethod, deliveryTerms, priority) remain visible but show raw codes pending backend fix.

## 2026-05-12 — ETP-3955: Contextual FK Selectors — Implementation

**Context:** JuanCarlos agentic validation reports identified that required FK selectors return empty results without context (businessPartner, isSOTrx, date). This blocks agents from creating transactional documents.

**Changes implemented in schema_forge:**

1. **Selector inventory script** (`scripts/selector-inventory.js`): Automated scan of all affected specs reporting selector inputMode, dependsOn, validationRule cascade params, and decision coverage. Output: CSV to stdout.

2. **Normalized decisions.json** for `return-to-vendor` and `return-to-vendor-shipment`:
   - Added `partnerAddress` with `dependsOn: { field: "businessPartner", filterKey: "C_BPartner_ID" }` and `inputMode: "dependent"`.
   - Added `businessPartner` field decisions with `selectorFilter: "isVendor=Y"`.
   - Changed `return-to-vendor.lines.tax` from `inputMode: search` to `inputMode: selector`.

3. **Extended `generate-contract.js`** with `buildSelectorContext()` function:
   - Generates `context.required` and `context.optional` arrays for each selector in `apiPrediction`.
   - Sources context from: `dependsOn` declarations, `validationRule.cascadeParams`, and window category.
   - Handles: `C_BPartner_ID` from dependsOn, `IsSOTrx` from window category, `DateInvoiced` from parent field with `DD-MM-YYYY` format, `priceList` and `partnerAddress` as optional parent fields.

4. **Created `selectorContext.js`** shared helper (`tools/app-shell/src/lib/selectorContext.js`):
   - Centralizes selector context derivation previously scattered in `DetailView.jsx`.
   - Exports: `buildSelectorContext()`, `buildHeaderSelectorContext()`, `buildLineSelectorContext()`, `formatIsoToClassicDate()`, `deriveIsSOTrx()`, `deriveRoleFlags()`, `resolveDateFromRecord()`.
   - 34 unit tests covering sales/purchase categories, date formatting, dependsOn mapping, context metadata processing, and fallback behavior.

5. **Added contract-generation tests** (`cli/test/generate-contract.test.js`):
   - 5 new tests verifying selector context metadata in `generateApiPrediction` output.
   - Covers: partnerAddress dependsOn, priceList isSOTrx, tax IsSOTrx+DateInvoiced, purchase mode, and simple FK without context.

**Test results:** `npm test` passes with 12,554 passing tests and 9 skipped tests. `npm --workspace @schema-forge/app-shell run test:vitest -- src/lib/__tests__/selectorContext.vitest.js` passes with 35/35 selector-context tests.

**Remaining work (com.etendoerp.go repo):**
- Extend MCP `neo_selectors` to accept `recordContext` and map to selector params.
- Add missing-context diagnostics to selector responses.
- Verify `neo_defaults` returns `transactionDocument` and default `priceList`.
- Add per-entity `NeoHandler` fallbacks where generic behavior is insufficient.
- Java/runtime tests for selector/default behavior.

## 2026-05-29 — ETP-4083: Tailwind purged core-package classes (transparent calendar background)

**Context:** In Sales Order, opening the calendar of the "Order Date" field showed the popover with a **transparent background** (the form fields behind it bled through). Reported visually on the `DateField`.

**Problem:** `DateField` and `PopoverContent` live in `packages/app-shell-core/src` and paint the background with the semantic class `bg-popover` (→ `hsl(var(--popover))`). The Tailwind `content` globs in `tools/app-shell/tailwind.config.js` only scanned `./src` and `artifacts/**/generated`, **not** the core package source. Since `bg-popover` appeared in no scanned file, Tailwind **purged** it from the final CSS → the popover ended up with no `background-color`. Verified: the built CSS (`dist/assets/*.css`) had **0** `.bg-popover` rules.

**Root cause:** UI components were moved to `packages/app-shell-core/src` (a previous task) without updating the Tailwind `content` globs to include that new path. It affected ALL classes used only in the core, not just `bg-popover` (also `dropdown-menu`, `command`, `select`, etc. with semantic tokens like `text-popover-foreground`).

**Fix:** Add a generic glob for the workspace package sources to the Tailwind `content` (not a single package, so any future package under `packages/` is covered automatically):
```js
content: [
  './index.html',
  './src/**/*.{js,jsx}',
  '../../artifacts/**/generated/**/*.{js,jsx}',
  '../../packages/*/src/**/*.{js,jsx}', // ← recovers classes from any workspace package
],
```

**Scope verified:** Of the 6 packages in `packages/`, only `app-shell-core` renders Tailwind UI (39 files with `className`, all under `src/`) and is imported by the app (46 files). The other 5 (`apps-sdk`, `apps-sdk-bff`, `schema-forge-core`, `schema-forge-stack`, `schema-forge-agent-context`) have no `className` and are not imported by the app. `app-shell-core` does not import UI from other packages, so there is no pending cascade scan. A single glob covers the whole problem.

**Prevention:** Any future move of components with Tailwind classes to a new package under `packages/` is already covered by the generic glob `../../packages/*/src/**`. A regression guard test was also added (`tools/app-shell/src/__tests__/tailwind-purge-guard.vitest.js`) that builds the real CSS and fails in CI if the semantic classes that exist only in the core (`bg-popover`, `text-popover-foreground`) get purged again — previously the build did not fail and the style silently disappeared. Verified: removing the glob makes the test fail 3/4; restoring it passes 4/4.

**Status:** Fixed.
