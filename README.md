# Schema Forge

Design and tooling layer for building a simplified Etendo interface. Schema Forge analyzes Etendo metadata, helps humans make design decisions, and configures the runtime module ([NEO Headless](docs/neo-headless-extensibility.md)) — no backend code generation needed.

Schema Forge decides **what** to expose. Etendo Go decides **how** to serve it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js >= 22** — [download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (ships with Node.js)
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — required for window locks and PR workflow
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install gh
  # Then authenticate:
  gh auth login
  ```
  [Install instructions for other platforms](https://cli.github.com/)
- **PostgreSQL** — access to an Etendo development database
- **Claude Code** — with the **Chrome DevTools MCP server** installed for UI testing and debugging
  - Install the MCP server: `claude mcp add chrome-devtools` or configure it in `.claude/settings.json`
  - See the [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) docs for setup details
- **Etendo Claude Marketplace** — Claude Code plugins for Etendo development
  - Install the marketplace and plugins:
    ```
    /plugin marketplace add etendosoftware/etendo_claude_marketplace
    /plugin install dev-assistant@etendo_claude_marketplace
    /plugin install etendo-workflow-manager@etendo_claude_marketplace
    ```
  - See the [marketplace repo](https://github.com/etendosoftware/etendo_claude_marketplace) for the full plugin reference

## Installation

### 1. Start from a working Etendo Core

You need a functional Etendo Core instance as the base. This gives Claude Code full access to the Etendo source code and database.

```bash
cd /path/to/etendo_core
git checkout feature/ETP-3519
```

Make sure Etendo compiles and runs correctly before proceeding.

### 2. Clone Schema Forge

Clone this repository **inside** the Etendo project directory (sibling to `modules/`):

```bash
cd /path/to/etendo_core
git clone git@github.com:etendosoftware/etendo_schema_forge.git schema_forge
cd schema_forge
git checkout develop
```

### 3. Clone com.etendoerp.go

Clone the runtime module into the Etendo `modules/` directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/etendo_core/modules
git clone git@github.com:etendosoftware/com.etendoerp.go.git
cd com.etendoerp.go
git checkout develop
```

### 4. Clone com.etendoerp.openapi (if needed)

If the build fails due to a missing dependency, clone the OpenAPI module:

```bash
cd /path/to/etendo_core/modules
git clone git@github.com:etendosoftware/com.etendoerp.openapi.git
cd com.etendoerp.openapi
git checkout main
```

### 5. Install Schema Forge dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/etendo_core/schema_forge
make install
```

This installs all workspace dependencies (CLI tools + UI tools).

### 6. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```env
# Path to your Etendo root (relative or absolute)
ETENDO_ROOT=..

# Database connection (optional — CLI auto-reads from gradle.properties)
ETENDO_DB_HOST=localhost
ETENDO_DB_PORT=5432
ETENDO_DB_USER=etendo
ETENDO_DB_PASSWORD=
ETENDO_DB_NAME=etendo_dev
```

> **Note:** The CLI tools auto-read DB credentials from `{ETENDO_ROOT}/gradle.properties`. The `.env` overrides are only needed if your setup differs.

### Expected directory structure

After installation, your project should look like this:

```
etendo_core/                    ← branch: feature/ETP-3519
├── modules/
│   ├── com.etendoerp.go/       ← branch: develop
│   └── com.etendoerp.openapi/  ← branch: main (if needed)
├── schema_forge/               ← branch: develop
└── gradle.properties
```

## First Steps (Claude Guided) (Recommended)
This tool is designed to be used iteratively through the Claude Code interface, interacting with the agent.

### 1. Start Etendo Classic
Make sure your Etendo instance is running and accessible. This allows the agent to use the backend endpoints for testing and validation during the pipeline execution. It can be in SmartTomcat or Dockerized Tomcat. The important thing is that the database is accessible.

### 1. Start a new conversation in Claude Code
- Open Claude Code and start a new conversation. IMPORTANT: Open the conversation in the schema_forge directory to ensure the agent has access to the correct context and files.

### 2. Set up the agent
- In the conversation, ask to set up the agent with the configuration required to work, such as "Etendo path", "Database credentials", "Menu cache", etc.

### 3. Start the UI in development mode
- Ask the agent to start the UI. It will install dependencies and start the development server. The UI will be available at http://localhost:3100. This UI will auto-refresh on changes.

### 4. Ask the agent to run the pipeline for a specific window or process
- You can ask the agent to run the pipeline for a specific window or process by providing the menu name or ID. For example, "Run the pipeline for the Sales Order window" or "Run the pipeline for menu ID 143". The agent will execute the pipeline steps, including metadata extraction, rule classification, contract generation, and frontend generation.

It is recommended to give the agent the "decisions" from the start so they can be applied automatically. This is not mandatory, as they can be provided before the "classification" step, but if given from the start, they can be applied immediately in the "classification" step and also used to "validate" the rules with the decisions in mind.


### 5. Change decisions and re-run the pipeline
- If you want to change any design decisions (e.g., field visibility, rule classifications), you can do so through the chat with the agent, and then re-run the pipeline to see the changes reflected in the generated UI. This will modify the "decisions" file so the changes will be persisted for future runs, and the pipeline steps that run will be the post-classification steps (contract generation, push to NEO, frontend generation, etc.), skipping the extraction and classification steps. Example: "Change the visibility of the 'Credit Limit' field to hidden and re-run the pipeline for the Sales Order window".


### 6. Use Claude to solve problems and errors
- When you encounter any issues, errors, or unexpected behavior during the pipeline execution or in the generated UI, you can ask the agent for help. It's important to differentiate between errors that are expected during development (e.g., due to incomplete implementations or edge cases) and those that indicate a problem with the pipeline or the generated code. You can ask the agent to analyze error messages, logs, or unexpected UI behavior to identify potential causes and solutions. Example: "I'm getting a validation error in the pipeline related to the 'Order Total' field. Can you help me understand why and how to fix it?"

### 7. Use the agent to test the UI or investigate issues
- "I have an issue with the generated UI for the Sales Order window. The 'Add Line' button is not working as expected. Can you help me debug this issue?" The agent can guide you through using the Chrome DevTools MCP server to inspect the frontend code, check network requests, and analyze logs to identify the root cause of the issue.

### 8. Deploy the UI to the Etendo Go module
- Once you are satisfied with the generated UI in development mode, you can ask the agent to deploy it to the Etendo Go module. The agent will build the frontend for production and copy the build artifacts to the correct location in the `com.etendoerp.go` module. Example: "Deploy the UI to the Etendo Go module".



## First Steps (Manual)
### 1. Refresh the menu cache

The menu cache indexes all Etendo windows, processes, and reports for fast lookup:

```bash
node cli/src/menu-cache.js refresh
```

### 2. Explore available windows and processes

```bash
# Search by name
node cli/src/menu-cache.js search "sales order"

# Filter by type
node cli/src/menu-cache.js search "invoice" --type window
node cli/src/menu-cache.js search "payment" --type process

# List all of a type
node cli/src/menu-cache.js list window
node cli/src/menu-cache.js list process
node cli/src/menu-cache.js list report
```

### 3. Run the pipeline for a window

The pipeline extracts metadata, classifies fields, generates contracts, configures NEO Headless, and generates the React frontend:

```bash
# By menu name (recommended — auto-detects type)
node cli/src/pipeline.js --menu-name "Sales Order"

# By menu ID
node cli/src/pipeline.js --menu-id 143
```

Pipeline steps (window mode):

| Phase | Step | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| F1a | extract-fields | Extract field metadata from Etendo DB |
| F1b | extract-rules | Extract business rules and callouts |
| F2 | validate | Validate schema (4 levels) |
| F3 | pre-classify | Auto-classify rules (deterministic + AI) |
| F4 | human-decisions | Open Decision Panel for human review |
| F6 | generate-contract | Generate frontend/backend contracts |
| F7 | push-to-neo | Configure NEO Headless (DB writes) |
| F8 | generate-frontend | Generate React components |
| F9 | run-tests | Run contract tests |

### 4. Start the dev server

Preview the generated UI with hot reload:

```bash
make dev
# → http://localhost:3100
```

By default it runs with mock data (`VITE_MOCK=true`). To connect to a live Etendo instance, edit `tools/app-shell/.env.development`:

```env
VITE_MOCK=false
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/etendo
```

### 5. Build and deploy to Etendo

```bash
make deploy
```

The built SPA is copied to `modules/com.etendoerp.go/web/com.etendoerp.go/` and served by Tomcat at `/etendo/web/com.etendoerp.go/` — no restart needed.

### 6. Run tests

```bash
make test
```
